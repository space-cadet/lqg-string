## Focus Task
T2: Address AOP Reviewer Comments
**Status**: 🔄 Active
**Time Spent**: 1.5 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### T2: Address AOP Reviewer Comments
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Completed all Section 3 reviewer responses (bimetric ghost avoidance, Kalb-Ramond derivation reference, bimetric concepts scope)
- Added paragraph in manuscript Section 3 addressing Boulware-Deser ghost limitations
- Completed Section 4(a) response on dilaton-like coupling physical interpretation
- Added expanded explanation in manuscript after equation 4.10 for coupling term
- Completed Section 4(b) response on Born-Infeld exactness requirement
- Removed exactness discussion from manuscript Section 4.2 as tangential to main argument
**Status Change**: Sections 3-4 responses → Sections 3-4 complete, ready for Section 5

## Files Modified
- `AoP/response-to-referee.tex` - Added complete responses for Sections 3(a-c) and 4(a-b)
- `lqg-strings.tex` - Added Boulware-Deser paragraph in Section 3, expanded coupling explanation after eq 4.10, removed exactness discussion from Section 4.2

## Key Decisions Made
- Acknowledged Boulware-Deser ghost analysis would require separate paper
- Emphasized novelty of bimetric string action approach
- Provided honest assessment that exactness discussion was tangential
- Focused responses on addressing reviewer concerns while maintaining paper scope

## Context for Next Session
Sections 3-4 of reviewer response complete. Next session should focus on Section 5 responses covering:
- Anomaly-free claims comparison to standard string theory
- Mode truncation validation and quantum gravity alignment
- Table 1 context for string spectrum values

## Next Session Priorities
1. Address Section 5(a) anomaly-free claims and standard string theory comparison
2. Address Section 5(b) mode truncation validation 
3. Address Section 5(c) Table 1 context and spectrum interpretation
