## Focus Task
T2: Address AOP Reviewer Comments
**Status**: 🔄 Active
**Time Spent**: Initial setup

## Tasks Worked On
### T1: Initialize Memory Bank System
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Initialized memory bank system for LQG string theory project
- Created comprehensive project brief and task structure
- Set up session tracking and progress monitoring
**Status Change**: Created → Completed

### T2: Address AOP Reviewer Comments
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Created detailed task breakdown for systematic reviewer response
- Established 13-step progress plan for manuscript revision
- Set up tracking for addressing all reviewer feedback sections
- Added background independence footnotes to Introduction addressing reviewer concern about recent developments in non-perturbative string theory
- Updated bibliography with 5 new references on background independence and string field theory
**Status Change**: Created → Active → In Progress

## Files Modified
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Created comprehensive project overview
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Established task registry with T1 active task
- `memory-bank/tasks/T1.md` - Detailed task breakdown for reviewer response
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Initialized session tracking system
- `lqg-strings.tex` - Added two footnotes addressing background independence concerns
- `lqg-strings.bib` - Added 5 new references on string theory background independence

## Key Decisions Made
- Structured reviewer response as systematic section-by-section approach
- Identified 13 major progress steps for comprehensive revision
- Established HIGH priority for timely manuscript revision (deadline May 27, 2025)

## Context for Next Session
Project requires systematic addressing of reviewer feedback across 7 main sections of the manuscript. Key focus areas include strengthening theoretical justifications, improving mathematical rigor, enhancing physical interpretations, and better connecting to existing literature.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Detailed analysis of reviewer comments section by section
2. Create specific response plan for Introduction improvements
3. Begin addressing Section 2 theoretical foundation issues
