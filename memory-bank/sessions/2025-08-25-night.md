## Focus Task
T4: AOP Final Minor Revisions
**Status**: 🔄 **Priority**: HIGH
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### T4: AOP Final Minor Revisions
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Created new task T4 for AOP final minor revisions with detailed checklist
- Analyzed compiled PDF - found main manuscript already clean (no typos present)
- Added Section 2 duality manifestation clarification (mass spectrum correspondence and correlation functions)
- Developed approach for Section 3.2 Kalb-Ramond field constraints using quantum Hall analogy
- Reviewed referee response document showing progress on clarifications

**Status Change**: New Task → 🔄 Active

## Files Modified
- `memory-bank/tasks/T4.md` - Created detailed task file with reviewer requirement checklist
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added T4 to active tasks registry
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Updated to reflect new active task
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Updated focus to T4 final revisions

## Key Decisions Made
- Confirmed main manuscript already clean - focus on content clarifications rather than typo fixes
- Adopted quantum Hall effect flux quantization analogy for Kalb-Ramond field constraints
- Established systematic approach for remaining reviewer clarifications

## Context for Next Session
Manuscript conditionally accepted - only minor clarifications needed. Four remaining items:
1. Section 6 phenomenological challenges acknowledgment 
2. Section 6 more support for (2+1)D spacetime claim
3. Appendix step-by-step derivation for Eq. 3.21
4. Section 7 cosmological horizon alignment discussion

## Next Session Priorities
1. Add Section 6 observational constraints acknowledgment
2. Find references supporting (2+1)D fundamental spacetime
3. Create appendix with detailed Eq. 3.21 derivation
4. Add cosmological data alignment discussion to Section 7
