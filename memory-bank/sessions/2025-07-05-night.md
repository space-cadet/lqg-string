## Focus Task
T2: Address AOP Reviewer Comments
**Status**: 🔄 Active
**Time Spent**: 2.5 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### T2: Address AOP Reviewer Comments
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Completed Section 6 responses addressing Afshordi model connection limitations
- Acknowledged lack of rigorous LQG derivation for mass parameter constraints  
- Extended caveats to (2+1)-dimensional spacetime speculation
- Completed Section 7 responses for holographic aspects
- Added scaling dimension interpretation of X^r through transformation properties
- Clarified AdS/CFT connection via radial coordinate analogy while noting key differences
**Status Change**: Section 6-7 responses → Ready for Discussion section

## Files Modified
- `AoP/response-to-referee.tex` - Added comprehensive responses for Sections 6a, 6b, 7a, 7b
- `lqg-strings.tex` - Added clarifying paragraph about X^r scaling dimension interpretation in Section 7B

## Key Decisions Made
- Acknowledged intellectual honesty about limitations rather than overselling connections
- Used transformation properties to justify scaling dimension interpretation
- Connected to AdS/CFT through concrete mathematical analogies while noting differences

## Context for Next Session
Section 6-7 responses complete. Remaining reviewer comments cover Discussion section improvements (experimental signatures, open questions) and general writing/proofreading. Need to address Discussion gaps and prepare final response document.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Address Discussion section concerns about experimental signatures
2. Add open questions and limitations acknowledgment  
3. Complete comprehensive proofreading
4. Finalize reviewer response document
5. Prepare for AOP resubmission
