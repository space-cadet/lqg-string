## Focus Task
T2: Address AOP Reviewer Comments
**Status**: 🔄 Active
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### T2: Address AOP Reviewer Comments
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Completed response to Section 2(a) - Action justification with honest acknowledgment that it's an ansatz
- Added manuscript paragraph explaining ansatz nature after S_MNG equation
- Addressed Section 2(b) - Expansion parameter k validity with LQG spin network emergence picture
- Completed response to Section 2(c) - h_ab/h^ab duality interpretation connecting to T/S-duality structure
- Enhanced physical understanding of duality as novel feature combining geometric and tension inversion
**Status Change**: Introduction complete → Section 2 (a,b,c) responses complete

## Files Modified
- `AoP/response-to-referee.tex` - Added detailed responses for Section 2(a), 2(b), 2(c) with physical justifications
- `lqg-strings.tex` - Added paragraph after S_MNG equation acknowledging ansatz nature and post-hoc validation

## Key Decisions Made
- Chose honest approach for action justification rather than overstating theoretical foundation
- Emphasized physical emergence picture for k expansion validity across regimes
- Connected novel duality to established T/S-duality framework while highlighting distinctiveness

## Context for Next Session
Continue with Section 3 responses: bimetric ghost avoidance, Kalb-Ramond derivation details, and background material for unfamiliar readers

## Next Session Priorities
1. Address Section 3(a) - Boulware-Deser ghost avoidance in bimetric string context
2. Work on Section 3(b) - Detailed derivation of Eq. (3.21) for Kalb-Ramond connection
3. Add Section 3(c) - Brief bimetric gravity background for general readers
