## Focus Task
T2: Address AOP Reviewer Comments
**Status**: 🔄 Active
**Time Spent**: 2.5 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### T2: Address AOP Reviewer Comments
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Completed Section 5 responses addressing anomaly claims, mode truncation, and Table 1 context
- Added clarification paragraphs to main manuscript after line 891 explaining "no anomalies" claim
- Added mode truncation discussion explaining physical motivation from LQG discreteness
- Added Table 1 context explanation after the table showing how values affect string spectrum
- All Section 5 reviewer concerns now fully addressed in both manuscript and response document

**Status Change**: Continuing → Section 5 Complete, ready for Section 6

## Files Modified
- `lqg-strings.tex` - Added clarification paragraphs after "no negative-norm states in physical processes" sentence
- `lqg-strings.tex` - Added Table 1 context explanation after the table
- `AoP/response-to-referee.tex` - Completed all Section 5 responses (5a, 5b, 5c)

## Key Decisions Made
- Clarified that "no anomalies" refers specifically to finite mode truncation avoiding central charge issues
- Acknowledged mode truncation as assumption requiring validation while providing LQG motivation
- Connected parameter μ from equation 4.27 to discreteness cutoff controlling maximum modes

## Context for Next Session
Section 5 responses complete. Ready to continue with remaining reviewer responses:
- Section 6: Afshordi model connection, fundamental spacetime dimensionality  
- Section 7: Holographic interpretation, AdS/CFT connection
- Discussion: Open questions, caveats on anomaly-free claims
- General: Writing and typos review

## Next Session Priorities
1. Address Section 6(a): Afshordi model connection and constraints on m_μ
2. Address Section 6(b): Evidence for (2+1)-dimensional fundamental spacetime
3. Continue systematic progression through remaining reviewer comments
