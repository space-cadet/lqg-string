## Project Overview

**Title**: A Loop Quantum Gravity Inspired Action for the Bosonic String and Emergent Dimensions at Large Scales

**Journal**: Annals of Physics (AOP)
**Manuscript ID**: AOP 81029
**Status**: Revision Required (Reviewer feedback received)
**Authors**: Luigi Teixeira de Sousa (Corresponding), Deepak Vaid

## Project Description

This research project develops a novel modification of the Nambu-Goto action for the bosonic string by incorporating insights from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), particularly the existence of a minimal area at the Planck scale. The work bridges concepts from string theory and LQG, proposing a "bimetric string" action and exploring its implications, including emergent dimensions and holography.

## Key Innovations

1. **Modified Nambu-Goto Action**: Incorporates LQG's minimal area concept through S_MNG = -T∫dx²√{-(h+kΔ)}
2. **Bimetric String Theory**: Develops connection to bimetric gravity framework
3. **Kalb-Ramond Field Connection**: Links Δ_ab to the Kalb-Ramond field B_μν
4. **Emergent Dimensions**: Proposes mechanism for dimensional emergence at large scales
5. **Holographic Properties**: Establishes connection to AdS/CFT correspondence

## Current Status

**Phase**: Major revision required based on reviewer feedback
**Deadline**: 21 days from May 6, 2025 (submission deadline: May 27, 2025)
**Review Status**: Not acceptable in current form but invited to revise and resubmit

## Research Goals

- Address all reviewer concerns systematically

- Improve physical interpretations and connections to existing literature
- Complete manuscript revision for resubmission to Annals of Physics

## Key Technical Areas

- Loop Quantum Gravity minimal area quantization
- String theory background independence
- Bimetric gravity analogies
- Covariant quantization procedures
- Holographic duality mechanisms
