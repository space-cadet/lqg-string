## Current Focus
**Task**: T4 - AOP Final Minor Revisions
**Phase**: Final revision for acceptance
**Priority**: HIGH

## Immediate Context
Manuscript has been conditionally accepted for publication! Editor is willing to accept with only minor corrections and clarifications. Reviewer feedback is very positive - theoretical framework is well-motivated and connections are clearly articulated. Only minor revisions needed within two weeks.

## Key Issues to Address
1. **Typos**: Polaykov→Polyakov, difence→difference, duplicate "high energy", incomplete sentences, formatting artifacts
2. **Cross-references**: Fix references not displaying properly
3. **Minor clarifications**: Brief additions for duality manifestation, Kalb-Ramond constraints, phenomenological challenges
4. **Bibliography**: Complete missing citations
5. **Enhanced discussions**: Cosmological horizon alignment, (2+1)D spacetime support

## Current Approach
Systematic correction of specific minor issues identified by reviewer for final acceptance.

## Critical Files
- `lqg-strings.tex` - Main manuscript requiring minor corrections
- `lqg-strings.bib` - Bibliography file for citation completion
- Editorial Manager submission system for final submission

## Next Steps
1. Fix all typos and formatting issues
2. Address cross-reference problems  
3. Add brief clarifications as requested
4. Submit within deadline (~September 1, 2025)
