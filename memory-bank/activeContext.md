## Current Focus
**Task**: T2 - Address AOP Reviewer Comments
**Phase**: Initial Analysis and Planning
**Priority**: HIGH

## Immediate Context
Working on revision of manuscript "A Loop Quantum Gravity Inspired Action for the Bosonic String and Emergent Dimensions at Large Scales" (AOP 81029) based on comprehensive reviewer feedback. The manuscript was deemed not acceptable in current form but invited for revision.

## Key Issues to Address
1. **Introduction**: Background independence discussion, minimal area contextualization
2. **Section 2**: Scalar density justification, k expansion assumptions, duality interpretation  
3. **Section 3**: Bimetric gravity connections, Kalb-Ramond derivation details
4. **Section 4**: Physical meanings of couplings, Born-Infeld requirements
5. **Section 5**: Quantization procedure validation, anomaly claims, mode truncation
6. **Section 6**: LQG connection strengthening, dimensional claims support
7. **Section 7**: Holographic interpretation clarity, AdS/CFT evidence
8. **Discussion**: Experimental signatures, limitation acknowledgments

## Current Approach
Systematic section-by-section analysis and revision with detailed point-by-point reviewer response preparation.

## Critical Files
- `lqg-strings.tex` - Main manuscript requiring revision
- Reviewer feedback document - Detailed technical comments
- `AoP/` directory - Journal submission materials

## Next Steps
1. Detailed analysis of reviewer comments
2. Create response plan for each major issue
3. Begin Introduction section improvements
