## Context

Reviewer provided comprehensive feedback indicating manuscript is not acceptable in current form but can be revised. Key issues span theoretical justifications, mathematical rigor, physical interpretations, and connections to existing literature. Revision deadline is 21 days from May 6, 2025.

**Progress Update**: Sections 1-7 responses complete. Addressed Section 6 concerns about Afshordi model connection by acknowledging lack of rigorous LQG derivation and extending caveats to (2+1)-dimensional spacetime speculation. Clarified Section 7 holographic aspects by explaining scaling dimension interpretation of X^r through transformation properties and connecting to AdS/CFT via radial coordinate analogy while noting key differences. Ready to proceed with Discussion section revisions.
