## Progress
1. ✅ **Typos and Minor Corrections Status Check**
   - Main manuscript appears clean - typos not found in compiled PDF
   - Cross-references displaying correctly in current version
   - No formatting artifacts visible in compiled output

2. ⬜ **Content Clarifications (Primary Focus)**
   - ✅ **Section 2**: Add brief mention of duality manifestation in observable string dynamics (e.g., through measurable spectra or scattering amplitudes)
   - ⬜ **Section 3.2**: Add comment on Kalb-Ramond field constraints (e.g., torsionless backgrounds)
   - ⬜ **Section 6**: Add acknowledgment of phenomenological challenges for emergent dimensions (e.g., observational constraints)
   - ⬜ **Section 6**: Add more support/references for (2+1)-dimensional spacetime claim
   - ⬜ **Section 7**: Add cosmological horizon alignment discussion (how might this align/conflict with current cosmological data)
   - ⬜ **Appendix**: Add step-by-step derivation for Eq. 3.21 in appendix or supplementary material

3. ⬜ **Bibliography Audit**
   - Check for citations referenced in text but missing from bibliography
   - Ensure all citations are complete and consistent

4. ⬜ **Final Review and Submission**
   - Test LaTeX compilation to verify all additions render properly
   - Submit revised manuscript through Editorial Manager
