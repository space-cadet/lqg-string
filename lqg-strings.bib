@book{Becker2006String,
	abstract = {String theory is one of the most exciting and challenging areas of modern theoretical physics. This book guides the reader from the basics of string theory to recent developments. It introduces the basics of perturbative string theory, world-sheet supersymmetry, space-time supersymmetry, conformal field theory and the heterotic string, before describing modern developments, including D-branes, string dualities and M-theory. It then covers string geometry and flux compactifications, applications to cosmology and particle physics, black holes in string theory and M-theory, and the microscopic origin of black-hole entropy. It concludes with Matrix theory, the AdS/CFT duality and its generalizations. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in modern string theory, and will make an excellent textbook for a one-year course on string theory. It contains over 120 exercises with solutions, and over 200 homework problems with solutions available on a password protected website for lecturers at www.cambridge.org/9780521860697.},

@misc{He2015Notes,
	abstract = {In this paper, we study the entanglement entropy in string theory in the simplest setup of dividing the nine dimensional space into two halves. This corresponds to the leading quantum correction to the horizon entropy in string theory on the Rindler space. This entropy is also called the conical entropy and includes surface term contributions. We first derive a new simple formula of the conical entropy for any free higher spin fields. Then we apply this formula to computations of conical entropy in open and closed superstring. In our analysis of closed string, we study the twisted conical entropy defined by making use of string theory on Melvin backgrounds. This quantity is easier to calculate owing to the folding trick. Our analysis shows that the entanglement entropy in closed superstring is UV finite owing to the string scale cutoff.},

In terms of the corresponding collective field theory this is a \{\textbackslash em nonperturbative\} effect and is related to the soft behaviour of the usual thermodynamic entropy at high temperatures. We then show that thermodynamic entropy of the singlet sector of the one dimensional matrix model at high temperatures is governed by nonperturbative effects of the underlying string theory. In the high temperature limit the ``exact'' expression for the entropy is regular but leads to a negative specific heat, thus implying an instability. We speculate that in a properly defined two dimensional string theory, the thermodynamic entropy could approach a constant at high temperatures and lead to a geometric entropy which is finite in the ultraviolet.},

@article{Das1996Degrees,
	abstract = {We discuss two issues regarding the question of degrees of freedom in two dimensional string theory. The first issue relates to the classical limit of quantum string theory. In the classical theory one requires an infinite number of fields in addition to the collective field to describe ``folds'' on the fermi surface. We argue that in the quantum theory these are not additional degrees of freedom. Rather they represent quantum dispersions of the collective field which are \{\textbackslash em not\} suppressed when \$\textbackslash hbar \textbackslash rightarrow 0\$ whenever a fold is present, thus leading to a nontrivial classical limit. The second issue relates to the ultraviolet properties of the geometric entropy. We argue that the geometric entropy is finite in the ultraviolet due to \{\textbackslash em nonperturbative\} effects. This indicates that the true degrees of freedom of the two dimensional string at high energies is much smaller than what one naively expects.

@misc{de-Vega1995Lectures,
	abstract = {Recent progress on string theory in curved spacetimes is reviewed. The string dynamics in cosmological and black hole spacetimes is investigated.The methods to solve the string equations of motion in curved spacetimes are described.That is, the perturbation approach, the null approach, the \$\textbackslash tau\$-expansion, and the construction of global solutions.The behaviour of strings in FRW and inflatio- nary spacetimes is obtained from the various types of string solutions. Three different types of behaviour appear:\{\textbackslash bf unstable, dual\} to unstable and \{\textbackslash bf stable\}.For the unstable strings, the energy and size grow proportional to \$R\$ for large scale factors \$R \textbackslash to \textbackslash infty\$. For the dual to unstable strings, the energy and size blow up for R\textbackslash to 0 as 1/R. For stable strings, the energy and size are bounded. (In Minkowski, all solutions are of the stable type). The self-consistent solution to the Einstein equations for string dominated universes is reviewed. The energy-momentum tensor for a gas of strings is taken as source and from the above behaviours the string equation of state is \{\textbackslash bf derived\}. The self-consistent string solution exhibits realistic matter dominated behaviour for large times and radiation dominated behaviour for early times. We report on the \{\textbackslash bf exact integrability\} of the string dynamics in de Sitter spacetime that allows to systematically find \{\textbackslash bf exact\} string solutions by soliton methods. \{\textbackslash bf Multistring solutions\} are a new feature in curved spacetimes. That is, a single world-sheet simultaneously describes many different and independent strings. This phenomenon has no analogue in flat spacetime and follows from the coupling of the strings with the geometry. Finally, the string dynamics next and inside a Schwarzschild black hole is analyzed and their physical properties discussed.},

@article{Maldacena1998The-Large,
	abstract = {We show that the large \$N\$ limit of certain conformal field theories in various dimensions include in their Hilbert space a sector describing supergravity on the product of Anti-deSitter spacetimes, spheres and other compact manifolds. This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large \$N\$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d \$\{\textbackslash cal N\} =4\$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings. We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-deSitter spacetimes are dual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for a definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compact dimensions.},

@article{Susskind1994The-World,
	abstract = {According to 't Hooft the combination of quantum mechanics and gravity requires the three dimensional world to be an image of data that can be stored on a two dimensional projection much like a holographic image. The two dimensional description only requires one discrete degree of freedom per Planck area and yet it is rich enough to describe all three dimensional phenomena. After outlining 't Hooft's proposal I give a preliminary informal description of how it may be implemented. One finds a basic requirement that particles must grow in size as their momenta are increased far above the Planck scale. The consequences for high energy particle collisions are described. The phenomena of particle growth with momentum was previously discussed in the context of string theory and was related to information spreading near black hole horizons. The considerations of this paper indicate that the effect is much more rapid at all but the earliest times. In fact the rate of spreading is found to saturate the bound from causality. Finally we consider string theory as a possible realization of 't Hooft's idea. The light front lattice string model of Klebanov and Susskind is reviewed and its similarities with the holographic theory are demonstrated. The agreement between the two requires unproven but plausible assumptions about the nonperturbative behavior of string theory. Very similar ideas to those in this paper have been long held by Charles Thorn.},

@article{t-Hooft1993Dimensional,
	abstract = {The requirement that physical phenomena associated with gravitational collapse should be duly reconciled with the postulates of quantum mechanics implies that at a Planckian scale our world is not 3+1 dimensional. Rather, the observable degrees of freedom can best be described as if they were Boolean variables defined on a two-dimensional lattice, evolving with time. This observation, deduced from not much more than unitarity, entropy and counting arguments, implies severe restrictions on possible models of quantum gravity. Using cellular automata as an example it is argued that this dimensional reduction implies more constraints than the freedom we have in constructing models. This is the main reason why so-far no completely consistent mathematical models of quantum black holes have been found. Essay dedicated to Abdus Salam.},

@misc{Ceplak2023The-Correspondence,
	abstract = {The correspondence principle between strings and black holes is a general framework for matching black holes and massive states of fundamental strings at a point where their physical properties (such as mass, entropy and temperature) smoothly agree with each other. This correspondence becomes puzzling when attempting to include rotation: At large enough spins, there exist degenerate string states that seemingly cannot be matched to any black hole. Conversely, there exist black holes with arbitrarily large spins that cannot correspond to any single-string state. We discuss in detail the properties of both types of objects and find that a correspondence that resolves the puzzles is possible by adding dynamical features and non-stationary configurations to the picture. Our scheme incorporates all black hole and string phases as part of the correspondence, save for one outlier which remains enigmatic: the near-extremal Kerr black hole. Along the way, we elaborate on general aspects of the correspondence that have not been emphasized before.},

The emphasis here is more on the brane dynamics than on supergravity solutions. We show how the low energy brane dynamics, combined with crucial inputs from AdS/CFT correspondence, leads to a derivation of black hole thermodynamics and the rate of Hawking radiation. Our approach requires a detailed exposition of the gauge theory and conformal field theory of the D1-D5 system. We also discuss some applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence in the context of black hole formation in three dimensions by thermal transition and by collision of point particles.},

	abstract = {The microscopic state counting of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\textbackslash "om black hole performed by Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa in 1996 has proven to be a central result in string theory. Here, with a philosophical readership in mind, the argument is presented in its contemporary context and its rather complex conceptual structure is analysed. In particular, we will identify the various inter-theoretic relations, such as duality and linkage relations, on which it depends. We further aim to make clear why the argument was immediately recognised as a successful accounting for the entropy of this black hole and how it engendered subsequent work that intended to strengthen the string theoretic analysis of black holes. Its relation to the formulation of the AdS/CFT conjecture will be briefly discussed, and the familiar reinterpretation of the entropy calculation in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence is given. Finally, we discuss the heuristic role that Strominger and Vafa's microscopic account of black hole entropy played for the black hole information paradox. A companion paper analyses the ontology of the Strominger-Vafa black hole states, the question of emergence of the black hole from a collection of D-branes, and the role of the correspondence principle in the context of string theory black holes.},

Our approach makes possible a consistent formulation and solution of a ground state problem (including the problem of space-time compactification) in the string theory. We suggest a solution to the old ``tachyon problem'' based on the generation of non-trivial vacuum values for the scalar field, metric and antisymmetric tensor. It is shown that a preferred compactification in the closed Bose string theory is to three (anti-de Sitter) space-time dimensions.},

The equations of motion are reduced to a system of equations for two scalar fields which in a particular case yields the Liouville equation. We have found and analysed stationary solutions with nontrivial torsion. It is proved that equations for extremals defining trajectories of pointlike spinless particles are completely integrable. A singularity of stationary space-time with nontrivial torsion has a repulsive character contrary to that of a black hole, and no particle can penetrate through it. Modification of the string theory due to the addition of the gravity Lagrangian is discussed.},

	abstract = {In this introductory review we discuss dynamical tests of the AdS\_5 x S\^5 string/N=4 super Yang-Mills duality. After a brief introduction to AdS/CFT we argue that semiclassical string energies yield information on the quantum spectrum of the string in the limit of large angular momenta on the S\^5. The energies of the folded and circular spinning string solutions rotating on a S\^3 within the S\^5 are derived, which yield all loop predictions for the dual gauge theory scaling dimensions. These follow from the eigenvalues of the dilatation operator of N=4 super Yang-Mills in a minimal SU(2) subsector and we display its reformulation in terms of a Heisenberg s=1/2 spin chain along with the coordinate Bethe ansatz for its explicit diagonalization. In order to make contact to the spinning string energies we then study the thermodynamic limit of the one-loop gauge theory Bethe equations and demonstrate the matching with the folded and closed string result at this loop order. Finally the known gauge theory results at higher-loop orders are reviewed and the associated long-range spin chain Bethe ansatz is introduced, leading to an asymptotic all-loop conjecture for the gauge theory Bethe equations. This uncovers discrepancies at the three-loop order between gauge theory scaling dimensions and string theory energies and the implications of this are discussed. Along the way we comment on further developments and generalizations of the subject and point to the relevant literature.},

Volume 1, first published in 1998, provides a thorough introduction to the bosonic string. The first four chapters introduce the central ideas of string theory, the tools of conformal field theory and of the Polyakov path integral, and the covariant quantization of the string. The next three chapters treat string interactions: the general formalism, and detailed treatments of the tree level and one loop amplitudes. Chapter eight covers toroidal compactification and many important aspects of string physics, such as T-duality and D-branes. Chapter nine treats higher-order amplitudes, including an analysis of their finiteness and unitarity, and various nonperturbative ideas. An appendix giving a short course on path integral methods is included. This is an essential text and reference for graduate students and researchers interested in modern superstring theory.},

@article{Scherk1974aDual,
	abstract = {The possibility of describing particles other than hadrons (leptons, photons, gauge bosons, gravitons, etc.) by a dual model is explored. The Virasoro-Shapiro model is studied first, interpreting the massless spin-two state of the model as a graviton. We prove that in the limit of zero slope (with gvs2{$\alpha{'}$} held fixed) one obtains the Einstein theory of gravitation accompanied by a massless scalar field. Next, the Veneziano model is studied for small slope as an expansion in powers of {$\alpha{'}$}. It is known from previous work that the zeroth order term is precisely the Yang-Mills theory of a multiplet of massless vector bosons. We show that there are order {$\alpha{'}$} terms arising both from the dual tree and loop graphs. The former constitutes a relatively unimportant modification of the Yang-Mills theory, whereas the latter involves the coupling of the massless scalar and graviton states of the Virasoro-Shapiro model. Thus one may take the point of view that gravity arises as a unitarization effect in a dual unified theory of electromagnetism and weak interactions. In order to obtain the correct values for the electric charge and Newton's constant it is necessary that {$\alpha{'}$} - 10-34GeV-2The coupling of massless scalar states is also studied. \textcopyright{} 1974.},

The resulting equations are explicitly solved for the torsion and dilaton fields, and the remaining equations cast in a simple form. Previously unnoticed topological obstructions to solving these equations are found. The equations are shown to agree to leading order in perturbation theory with those derived in a field theory approach, provided one considers a more general ansatz than in previous analyses by allowing for a warp factor for the metric. Exact solutions with non-zero torsion are found, indicating a new class of finite sigma models. These solutions break the E{$\chi$} {$\otimes$} E{$\chi$} or SO(32) gauge group down to a large variety of subgroups. Orbifolds with torsion are constructed. A perturbative analysis of the equations indicates a class of solutions whose existence has been recently argued for on other grounds. Brief comments are made on the implications for phenomenology.},

The first paper gives a conceptual analysis of the Strominger-Vafa argument, and of several research efforts that it engendered. In this paper, we assess whether the black hole should be considered as emergent from the D-brane system, particularly in light of the role that duality plays in the argument. We further identify uses of the quantum-to-classical correspondence principle in string theory discussions of black holes, and compare these to the heuristics of earlier efforts in theory construction, in particular those of the old quantum theory.},

Several examples are discussed. The behavior of the Regge residue {$\beta\rho\pi\pi$}(t) at {$\alpha\rho$}(t)=0 is proposed as a test that distinguishes the two representations.},
