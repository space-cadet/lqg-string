@article{Collaboration2020Planck,
	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_c h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.120{\textbackslash}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.0224{\textbackslash}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965{\textbackslash}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \${\textbackslash}tau = 0.054{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ precision, with \$100{\textbackslash}theta\_*=1.0411{\textbackslash}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4{\textbackslash}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.315{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.811{\textbackslash}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} = 2.99{\textbackslash}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM at over \$2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

@article{Peebles2003Cosmological,
	abstract = {Physics invites the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational effect approximates that of Einstein's cosmological constant, Lambda; nowadays the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence. Physics also suggests the dark energy could be dynamical, allowing the arguably appealing picture that the dark energy density is evolving to its natural value, zero, and is small now because the expanding universe is old. This alleviates the classical problem of the curious energy scale of order a millielectronvolt associated with a constant Lambda. Dark energy may have been detected by recent advances in the cosmological tests. The tests establish a good scientific case for the context, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lemaitre model, including the gravitational inverse square law applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one quarter of the critical Einstein-de Sitter value. The case for detection of dark energy is serious but not yet as convincing; we await more checks that may come out of work in progress. Planned observations might be capable of detecting evolution of the dark energy density; a positive result would be a considerable stimulus to attempts to understand the microphysics of dark energy. This review presents the basic physics and astronomy of the subject, reviews the history of ideas, assesses the state of the observational evidence, and comments on recent developments in the search for a fundamental theory.},

@article{Markopoulou1997Causal,
	abstract = {A new approach to quantum gravity is described which joins the loop representation formulation of the canonical theory to the causal set formulation of the path integral. The theory assigns quantum amplitudes to special classes of causal sets, which consist of spin networks representing quantum states of the gravitational field joined together by labeled null edges. The theory exists in 3+1, 2+1 and 1+1 dimensional versions, and may also be interepreted as a theory of labeled timelike surfaces. The dynamics is specified by a choice of functions of the labelings of d+1 dimensional simplices,which represent elementary future light cones of events in these discrete spacetimes. The quantum dynamics thus respects the discrete causal structure of the causal sets. In the 1+1 dimensional case the theory is closely related to directed percolation models. In this case, at least, the theory may have critical behavior associated with percolation, leading to the existence of a classical limit.},

We show that this is possible if the energy is not so extreme to cause a gravitational instability and when the scattering angle approaches some critical value from below. Above this angle, the distance starts increasing, thus departing from the usual position-momentum uncertainty relation, and in no instance is the resolution smaller than the string length. This suggests that below the Planck scale the very concept of space-time changes meaning.},

In this limit, furthermore, the amplitudes fall off in a stringy way - much faster than that allowed by field theory.

@article{Yoneya2000String,
	abstract = {The notion of a space-time uncertainty principle in string theory is clarified and further developed. The motivation and the derivation of the principle are first reviewed in a reasonably self-contained way. It is then shown that the nonperturbative (Borel summed) high-energy and high-momentum transfer behavior of string scattering is consistent with the space-time uncertainty principle. It is also shown that, in consequence of the principle, string theories in 10 dimensions generically exhibit a characteristic length scale which is equal to the well-known 11 dimensional Planck length \$g\_s{\textasciicircum}\{1/3\}{\textbackslash}ell\_s\$ of M-theory as the scale at which stringy effects take over the effects of classical supergravity, even without involving D-branes directly. The meanings of the space-time uncertainty relation in connection with D-branes and black holes are discussed and reinterpreted. Finally, we present a novel interpretation of the Schild-gauge action for strings from a viewpoint of noncommutative geometry, which conforms to the space-time uncertainty relation by manifestly exhibiting a noncommutativity of quantized string coordinates dominantly between space and time. We also discuss the consistency of the space-time uncertainty relation with S and T dualities.},

This book aspires to offer definitive answers to both of these questions, by (a) charting the space of possible definitions of background independence, and (b) applying said definitions to various classical and quantum theories of gravity. The outcome, in brief, is as follows: General Relativity is not unique by virtue of its background independence (and, indeed, fails to be background independent on some popular definitions); moreover, the situation in the case of quantum theories of gravity is delicate, because (i) there are viable such theories which (by some accounts, at least) fail to be background independent, but also (ii) theories (e.g. perturbative string theory) which have often been dismissed for (allegedly) being background dependent in fact, on many accounts, are better classified as background independent.

Indeed, with this data we construct an antibracket preserving map between the state spaces of two nearby conformal theories taking the corresponding string field measures \$d{\textbackslash}mu e{\textasciicircum}\{2S/{\textbackslash}hbar\}\$ into each other. A geometrical construction of the map is achieved by introducing a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra on spaces of Riemann surfaces, together with a map to the BV algebra of string functionals. The conditions of background independence show that the field independent terms of the master action arise from vacuum vertices \${\textbackslash}V\_\{g,0\}\$, and that the overall \${\textbackslash}hbar\$-independent normalization of the string field measure involves the theory space connection. Our result puts on firm ground the widely believed statement that string theories built from nearby conformal theories are different states of the same theory.},

@article{Scherk1974bDual,
	abstract = {The possibility of describing particles other than hadrons (leptons, photons, gauge bosons, gravitons, etc.) by a dual model is explored. The Virasoro-Shapiro model is studied first, interpreting the massless spin-two state of the model as a graviton. We prove that in the limit of zero slope (with gvs2{$\alpha\prime$} held fixed) one obtains the Einstein theory of gravitation accompanied by a massless scalar field. Next, the Veneziano model is studied for small slope as an expansion in powers of {$\alpha\prime$}. It is known from previous work that the zeroth order term is precisely the Yang-Mills theory of a multiplet of massless vector bosons. We show that there are order {$\alpha\prime$} terms arising both from the dual tree and loop graphs. The former constitutes a relatively unimportant modification of the Yang-Mills theory, whereas the latter involves the coupling of the massless scalar and graviton states of the Virasoro-Shapiro model. Thus one may take the point of view that gravity arises as a unitarization effect in a dual unified theory of electromagnetism and weak interactions. In order to obtain the correct values for the electric charge and Newton's constant it is necessary that {$\alpha\prime$} - 10-34GeV-2The coupling of massless scalar states is also studied. {\copyright} 1974.},

A characteristic feature of my approach was that I used thinking of very high order "fishnet" or planar Feynman diagrams as the way of at first describing the development of the strings. A chain of constituents leads to planar diagrams dominating when only neighbours on the chain interact significantly. The article also mentions the works of Ziro Koba and mine about extending the Veneziano model first to five external particles - as Bardakci and Ruegg, Chan Tsou, and Goebel and Sakita also did - and subsequently to an arbitrary number n of external mesons.},

The appropriate models should yield the spectra which can produce the concave Regge trajectories according to the concavity of the meson Regge trajectories.

The purpose of such an enlargement is not purely academic but opens new possibilities in discussing the connection between potentials and scattering amplitudes. In particular it is shown that under reasonable assumptions, fulfilled by most field theoretical potentials, the scattering amplitude at some fixed energy determines the potential uniquely, when it exists. Moreover for special classes of potentialsV(x), which are analytically continuable into a functionV(z),z=x+iy, regular and suitable bounded inx {$>$} 0, the scattering amplitude has the remarcable property of being continuable for arbitrary negative and large cosine of the scattering angle and therefore for arbitrary large real and positive transmitted momentum. The range of validity of the dispersion relations is therefore much enlarged.},

@article{Westman2015An-introduction,
	abstract = {A distance can be measured by monitoring how much a wheel has rotated when rolled without slipping. This simple idea underlies the mathematics of Cartan geometry. The Cartan-geometric description of gravity consists of a SO(1, 4) gauge connection A\textsuperscript{AB}(x) and a gravitational Higgs field V\textsuperscript{A}(x) which breaks the gauge symmetry. The clear similarity with symmetry-broken Yang-Mills theory suggests strongly the existence of a new field V\textsuperscript{A} in nature: the gravitational Higgs field. By treating V\textsuperscript{A} as a genuine dynamical field we arrive at a natural generalization of General Relativity with a wealth of new phenomenology. Importantly, General Relativity is reproduced exactly in the limit that the SO(1, 4) norm V\textsuperscript{2}(x) tends to a positive constant. We show that in regions wherein V\textsuperscript{2} varies-but has a definite sign-the Cartan-geometric formulation is a particular version of a scalar-tensor theory (in the sense of gravity being described by a scalar field {$\phi$}, metric tensor g{$<$}inf{$>\mu\nu<$}/inf{$>$}, and possibly a torsion tensor T{$\mu\nu\rho$}). A specific choice of action yields the Peebles-Ratra quintessence model whilst more general actions are shown to exhibit propagation of torsion. Regions where the sign of V\textsuperscript{2} changes correspond to a change in signature of the geometry. Specifically, a simple choice of action with FRW symmetry imposed yields, without any additional ad hoc assumptions, a classical analogue of the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal with the big bang singularity replaced by signature change. Cosmological solutions from more general actions are described, none of which have a big bang singularity, with most solutions reproducing General Relativity, or its Euclidean version, for late cosmological times. Requiring that gravity couples to matter fields through the gauge prescription forces a fundamental change in the description of bosonic matter fields: the equations of motion of all matter fields become first-order partial differential equations with the scalar and Dirac actions taking on structurally similar first-order forms. All matter actions reduce to the standard ones in the limit V\textsuperscript{2}{$\rightarrow$}const. We argue that Cartan geometry may function as a novel platform for inspiring and exploring modified theories of gravity with applications to dark energy, black holes, and early-universe cosmology. We end by listing a set of open problems.},

	abstract = {The geometric content of the MacDowell--Mansouri formulation of general relativity is best understood in terms of Cartan geometry. In particular, Cartan geometry gives clear geometric meaning to the MacDowell--Mansouri trick of combining the Levi-Civita connection and coframe field, or soldering form, into a single physical field. The Cartan perspective allows us to view physical spacetime as tangentially approximated by an arbitrary homogeneous 'model spacetime', including not only the flat Minkowski model, as is implicitly used in standard general relativity, but also de Sitter, anti-de Sitter or other models. A 'Cartan connection' gives a prescription for parallel transport from one 'tangent model spacetime' to another, along any path, giving a natural interpretation of the MacDowell--Mansouri connection as 'rolling' the model spacetime along physical spacetime. I explain Cartan geometry, and 'Cartan gauge theory', in which the gauge field is replaced by a Cartan connection. In particular, I discuss MacDowell--Mansouri gravity, as well as its more recent reformulation in terms of BF theory, in the context of Cartan connections.},

@article{Rovelli1998Loop,
	abstract = {The problem of finding the quantum theory of the gravitational field, and thus understanding what is quantum spacetime, is still open. One of the most active of the current approaches is loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity is a mathematically well-defined, non-perturbative and background independent quantization of general relativity, with its conventional matter couplings. The research in loop quantum gravity forms today a vast area, ranging from mathematical foundations to physical applications. Among the most significative results obtained are: (i) The computation of the physical spectra of geometrical quantities such as area and volume; which yields quantitative predictions on Planck-scale physics. (ii) A derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy formula. (iii) An intriguing physical picture of the microstructure of quantum physical space, characterized by a polymer-like Planck scale discreteness. This discreteness emerges naturally from the quantum theory and provides a mathematically well-defined realization of Wheeler's intuition of a spacetime ``foam''. Long standing open problems within the approach (lack of a scalar product, overcompleteness of the loop basis, implementation of reality conditions) have been fully solved. The weak part of the approach is the treatment of the dynamics: at present there exist several proposals, which are intensely debated. Here, I provide a general overview of ideas, techniques, results and open problems of this candidate theory of quantum gravity, and a guide to the relevant literature.},

	abstract = {The Poincar{\textbackslash}'e (inhomogeneous Lorentz) group underlies special relativity. In these lectures a consistent formalism is developed allowing an appropriate gauging of the Poincar{\textbackslash}'e group. The physical laws are formulated in terms of points, orthonormal tetrad frames, and components of the matter fields with respect to these frames. The laws are postulated to be gauge invariant under local Poincar{\textbackslash}'e transformations. This implies the existence of 4 translational gauge potentials \$\{e\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha\$ (``gravitons") and 6 Lorentz gauge potentials \$\{{\textbackslash}Gamma\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}beta\}\$ (``rotons") and the coupling of the momentum current and the spin current of matter to these potentials, respectively. In this way one is led to a Riemann-Cartan spacetime carrying torsion and curvature, richer in structure than the spacetime of general relativity. The Riemann-Cartan spacetime is controlled by the two general gauge field equations (3.44) and (3.45), in which material momentum and spin act as sources. The general framework of the theory is summarized in a table in Section 3.6. -- Options for picking a gauge field lagrangian are discussed (teleparallelism, ECSK). We propose a lagrangian quadratic in torsion and curvature governing the propagation of gravitons and rotons. A suppression of the rotons leads back to general relativity.},

@article{Afshordi2014Emergent,
	abstract = {Changing the dimensionality of the space-time at the smallest and largest distances has manifold theoretical advantages. If the space is lower dimensional in the high energy regime, then there are no ultraviolet divergencies in field theories, it is possible to quantize gravity, and the theory of matter plus gravity is free of divergencies or renormalizable. If the space is higher dimensional at cosmological scales, then some cosmological problems (including the cosmological constant problem) can be attacked from a completely new perspective. In this paper, we construct an explicit model of "evolving dimensions" in which the dimensions open up as the temperature of the universe drops. We adopt the string theory framework in which the dimensions are fields that live on the string worldsheet, and add temperature dependent mass terms for them. At the Big Bang, all the dimensions are very heavy and are not excited. As the universe cools down, dimensions open up one by one. Thus, the dimensionality of the space we live in depends on the energy or temperature that we are probing. In particular, we provide a kinematic Brandenberger-Vafa argument for how a discrete causal set, and eventually a continuum (3. +. 1)-dim spacetime along with Einstein gravity emerges in the Infrared from the worldsheet action. The (3. +. 1)-dim Planck mass and the string scale become directly related, without any compactification. Amongst other predictions, we argue that LHC might be blind to new physics even if it comes at the TeV scale. In contrast, cosmic ray experiments, especially those that can register the very beginning of the shower, and collisions with high multiplicity and density of particles, might be sensitive to the dimensional cross-over.},

The Fock space of graviton states and its associated algebra of observables are represented in terms of functionals of loops. The ``reality conditions'' are realized by an inner product that is chiral asymmetric, resulting in a chiral asymmetric ordering for the Hamiltonian and in an asymmetric description of the left and right handed gravitons. This chirally asymmetric formulation depends on a splitting of the linearized field into self-dual and anti-self dual parts rather than into positive and negative frequency parts; as the former, but not the latter, is meaningful away from flat backgrounds this is expected to be useful in connecting the nonperturbative theory to the linearized theory. The formalism depends on an arbitrary ``averaging'' function that controls certain divergences, but does not appear in the final physical quantities. Inspite of these somewhat unusual features, the loop quntization presented here is completely equivalent to the standard quantization of linearized gravity.},

@article{Rovelli1990Loop,
	abstract = {We define a new representation for quantum general relativity, in which exact solutions of the quantum constraints may be obtained. The representation is constructed by means of a noncanonical graded Poisson algebra of classical observables, defined in terms of Ashtekar's new variables. The observables in this algebra are nonlocal and involve parallel transport around loops in a three-manifold {$\Sigma$}. The theory is quantized by constructing a linear representation of a deformation of this algebra. This representation is given in terms of an algebra of linear operators defined on a state space which consists of functionals of sets of loops in {$\Sigma$}. The construction is general and can be applied also to Yang-Mills theories. The diffeomorphism constraint is defined in terms of a natural representation of the diffeomorphism group. The hamiltonian constraint, which contains the dynamics of quantum gravity, is constructed as a limit of a sequence of observables which incorporates a regularization prescription. We give the general solution of the diffeomorphism constraint in closed form. It is spanned by a countable basis which is in one-to-one correspondence with the diffeomorphism equivalence classes of multiple loops, which are a generalization of the link classes studied in knot theory. Then we explicitly construct, in closed form, a large space of solution of the entire set of constraints, including the hamiltonian constraint. These turn out to be classified by the ordinary knot and link classes of {$\Sigma$}. The space of solutions that we find is a sector of the physical states space of nonperturbative quantum general relativity. The failure of perturbation theory is thus shown to be not relevant to the problem of the existence of a nontrivial physical state space in quantum gravity. The relationship between this new loop representation and the self-dual representation of Ashtekar is illuminated by means of a functional transform between states in the two representations. Questions of the completeness of the solution space, the meaning of the physical operators and the physical inner product, are discussed, but not, so far, resolved. {\copyright} 1990.},

	abstract = {Area metrics and area metric backgrounds provide a unified framework for quantum gravity. They encode physical degrees of freedom beyond those of a metric. These non-metric degrees of freedom must be suppressed by a potential at sufficiently high energy scales to ensure that in the infrared regime classical gravity is recovered. On this basis, we first study necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for an area metric to be induced by a metric. Second, we consider candidate potentials for the area metric and point out a possible connection between the reduction of area metric geometry to metric geometry on the one hand, and the smallness of the cosmological constant on the other. Finally, we consider modifications of the Nambu-Goto action for a string, from a metric background to an area metric background. We demonstrate that area metric perturbations introduce an interaction corresponding to a singular vertex operator in the classically equivalent Polyakov action. The implications of these types of vertex operators for the quantum theory remain to be understood.},

Notoriously, however, the PGT terms which propagate vector torsion lead to strongly-coupled ghosts: the modern view is that only scalar torsion can propagate. To fix this, we revisit the concept of embedding explicit mass scales in scale-invariant theories, showing how the Klein-Gordon theory naturally leads to a slowly-rolling inflaton. We then show that the unique scale-invariant embedding of PGT leads to two new terms, one of which is the Maxwell term for vector torsion. We provide the full spectrum of quantum particles in the resulting theory. Our result means that every PGT is conformal and - after a two-decade hiatus - vector torsion is back on the menu.},

To what extent are we justified in endorsing different attitudes -- nowadays called sophistication, haecceitism, and eliminativism -- towards each? This is the first of four papers taking up this question. This first paper will discuss notions of symmetries and isomorphisms that will be used in the remaining papers in the series. There are several such notions in the literature and the question of how they mesh with empirical discernibility is a delicate one; even the orthodox view that symmetries are empirically unobservable (even in principle) has recently been challenged by Belot. Focusing on local field theories, I will provide a precise definition of dynamical symmetries in terms of the space of states of the theory at hand. I will then apply the definition to Yang-Mills theories and general relativity and show that these symmetries correspond to automorphisms of `natural' geometric structures: the small diffeomorphisms of the spacetime manifold and the small fiber-preserving diffeomorphisms of a fibered space. Finally, I will show that these automorphisms can be given a passive gloss, since they correspond 1-1 to the coordinate transformations of the underlying manifolds.},

Interestingly, the version of quantum error correction which is best suited to our analysis is the somewhat nonstandard "operator algebra quantum error correction" of Beny, Kempf, and Kribs. Our proposal gives a precise formulation of the idea of "subregion-subregion" duality in AdS/CFT, and clarifies the limits of its validity.},

The entire tensor network is an encoder for a quantum error-correcting code, where the bulk and boundary degrees of freedom may be identified as logical and physical degrees of freedom respectively. These models capture key features of entanglement in the AdS/CFT correspondence; in particular, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the negativity of tripartite information are obeyed exactly in many cases. That bulk logical operators can be represented on multiple boundary regions mimics the Rindler-wedge reconstruction of boundary operators from bulk operators, realizing explicitly the quantum error-correcting features of AdS/CFT recently proposed by Almheiri et. al in arXiv:1411.7041.},

Their properties are similar to those of supersymmetric generalizations which can be solved by the AdS/CFT correspondence; the low energy limit of the latter models is described by a AdS2 geometry. Then I turn to Kondo lattice models, which can be described by a mean- field theory obtained by a mapping to a quantum impurity coupled to a self-consistent environment. Such a theory yields a 'fractionalized Fermi liquid' phase of conduction electrons coupled to a critical spin liquid state, and is an attractive mean-field theory of strange metals. The recent holographic description of strange metals with a AdS2 x R2 geometry is argued to be related to such mean-field solutions of Kondo lattice models.},

@article{Guica2009The-Kerr/CFT,
	abstract = {Quantum gravity in the region very near the horizon of an extreme Kerr black hole (whose angular momentum and mass are related by J=GM{\textasciicircum}2) is considered. It is shown that consistent boundary conditions exist, for which the asymptotic symmetry generators form one copy of the Virasoro algebra with central charge c\_L=12J / {\textbackslash}hbar. This implies that the near-horizon quantum states can be identified with those of (a chiral half of) a two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). Moreover, in the extreme limit, the Frolov-Thorne vacuum state reduces to a thermal density matrix with dimensionless temperature T\_L=1/2{\textbackslash}pi and conjugate energy given by the zero mode generator, L\_0, of the Virasoro algebra. Assuming unitarity, the Cardy formula then gives a microscopic entropy S\_\{micro\}=2{\textbackslash}pi J / {\textbackslash}hbar for the CFT, which reproduces the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S\_\{macro\}=Area / 4{\textbackslash}hbar G. The results apply to any consistent unitary quantum theory of gravity with a Kerr solution. We accordingly conjecture that extreme Kerr black holes are holographically dual to a chiral two-dimensional conformal field theory with central charge c\_L=12J / {\textbackslash}hbar, and in particular that the near-extreme black hole GRS 1915+105 is approximately dual to a CFT with c\_L {\textbackslash}sim 2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{79\}.},

Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on \$AdS\_5{\textbackslash}times \{{\textbackslash}bf S\}{\textasciicircum}5\$ match with the chiral operators of \${\textbackslash}N=4\$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions, one can deduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the \${\textbackslash}N=4\$ theory has a large \$N\$ phase transition related to the thermodynamics of \$AdS\$ black holes.},

@article{Ashtekar1987New,
	abstract = {The phase space of general relativity is first extended in a standard manner to incorporate spinors. New coordinates are then introduced on this enlarged phase space to simplify the structure of constraint equations. Now, the basic variables, satisfying the canonical Poisson-brackets relations, are the (density-valued) soldering forms {\~undefined} a A B and certain spin-connection one-forms AaA B. Constraints of Einstein's theory simply state that {\~undefined} a satisfies the Gauss law constraint with respect to Aa and that the curvature tensor FabA B and Aa satisfies certain purely algebraic conditions (involving {\~undefined} a). In particular, the constraints are at worst quadratic in the new variables {\~undefined} a and Aa. This is in striking contrast with the situation with traditional variables, where constraints contain nonpolynomial functions of the three-metric. Simplification occurs because Aa has information about both the three-metric and its conjugate momentum. In the four-dimensional space-time picture, Aa turns out to be a potential for the self-dual part of Weyl curvature. An important feature of the new form of constraints is that it provides a natural embedding of the constraint surface of the Einstein phase space into that of Yang-Mills phase space. This embedding provides new tools to analyze a number of issues in both classical and quantum gravity. Some illustrative applications are discussed. Finally, the (Poisson-bracket) algebra of new constraints is computed. The framework sets the stage for another approach to canonical quantum gravity, discussed in forthcoming papers also by Jacobson, Lee, Renteln, and Smolin.},

@misc{Cheung2024Generalized,
	abstract = {We explore generalized symmetry in the context of nonlinear dynamical gravity. Our basic strategy is to transcribe known results from Yang-Mills theory directly to gravity via the tetrad formalism, which recasts general relativity as a gauge theory of the local Lorentz group. By analogy, we deduce that gravity exhibits a one-form symmetry implemented by an operator \$U\_{\textbackslash}alpha\$ labeled by a center element \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ of the Lorentz group and associated with a certain area measured in Planck units. The corresponding charged line operator \$W\_{\textbackslash}rho\$ is the holonomy in a spin representation \${\textbackslash}rho\$, which is the gravitational analog of a Wilson loop. The topological linking of \$U\_{\textbackslash}alpha\$ and \$W\_{\textbackslash}rho\$ has an elegant physical interpretation from classical gravitation: the former materializes an exotic chiral cosmic string defect whose quantized conical deficit angle is measured by the latter. We verify this claim explicitly in an AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. Notably, our conclusions imply that the standard model exhibits a new symmetry of nature at scales below the lightest neutrino mass. More generally, the absence of global symmetries in quantum gravity suggests that the gravitational one-form symmetry is either gauged or explicitly broken. The latter mandates the existence of fermions. Finally, we comment on generalizations to magnetic higher-form or higher-group gravitational symmetries.},

Such a model can be constructed in the AdS/CFT correspondence by gluing a bath on the asymptotic boundary of the bulk anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. This bath models a laboratory and is described by a quantum field theory. In the dual conformal field theory (CFT) description this coupling is achieved by a double-trace deformation that couples the CFT with the bath. This suggests that the physics observed by the laboratory is fully unitary. In this paper, we analyze the quantum aspects of this model in detail which conveys new lessons about the AdS/CFT correspondence, and we discuss the potential usefulness of this model in understanding subregion physics in a gravitational universe.},

Recently, a family of non-linear massive gravity actions, formulated with a flat reference metric, were proposed and shown to be ghost free at the complete non-linear level. In this paper we consider these non-linear massive gravity actions but now formulated with a general reference metric. We extend the proof of the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost to this case. The analysis is carried out in the ADM formalism at the complete non-linear level. We show that in these models there always exists a Hamiltonian constraint which, with an associated secondary constraint, eliminates the ghost. This result considerably extends the range of known consistent non-linear massive gravity theories. In addition, these theories can also be used to describe a massive spin-2 field in an arbitrary, fixed gravitational background. We also discuss the positivity of the Hamiltonian.},

	abstract = {Einstein's theory in the vacuum was recently shown to possess an \$SO(2)\$ duality invariance, which is broken by coupling to matter. Duality invariance can be restored by enlarging the phase space of the theory to allow for violations of the algebraic Bianchi identity. We show that in cases where the matter content can be understood as a component of the torsion tensor duality can be restored and we compute the corresponding duality current. We consider the case of NS-NS gravity as an example and find that the duality current is given by the divergence of the axion. In the linearized approximation of the low energy heterotic string theory these results imply that duality of the generalized Riemann curvature tensor implements Riemannian, axion-dilaton and electro-magnetic dualities simultaneously.},

The method is first applied to the harmonic oscillator interacting with a conserved current and in a second example to string theory in the presence of constant dilaton, Kalb-Ramond or gravitational fields. The derived interaction for the Kalb-Ramond background is periodic and the interactions with a dilaton respectively a gravitational field exhibit a strong-weak-coupling duality.

In this work, we explore the possibility of such a string-theoretic emergence of ghost-free bimetric theory, a recently proposed theory that involves two dynamical metrics, that around particular backgrounds propagates the graviton and a massive spin-2 field, which has been argued to be a viable dark matter candidate. By choosing to identify the latter with a massive spin-2 state of open string spectra, we compute tree-level three-point string scattering amplitudes that describe interactions of the massive spin-2 with itself and with the graviton. With the mass of the external legs depending on the string scale, we discover that extracting the corresponding low-energy effective actions in four spacetime dimensions is a subtle but consistent process and proceed to appropriately compare them with bimetric theory. Our findings consist in establishing that string and bimetric theory provide to lowest order the same set of two-derivative terms describing the interactions of the massive spin-2 with itself and with the graviton, albeit up to numerical coefficient discrepancies, a fact that we analyze and interpret. We conclude with a mention of future investigations.},

We evaluate the renormalization group flows of this sigma model on a flat worldsheet and derive a set of beta-functionals for the bimetric fields. Imposing worldsheet Weyl invariance at the quantum level, we uncover a set of gravitational field equations that dictate the dynamics of the bimetric fields in the target space, where a unique massless spin-two excitation emerges. When the bimetric fields become identical, the sigma model gains an emergent Lorentz symmetry. In this single metric limit, the beta-functionals of the bimetric fields reduce to the Ricci flow equation that arises in bosonic string theory, and the bimetric gravitational field equations give rise to Einstein's gravity.},

Recently, a family of non-linear massive gravity actions, formulated with a flat reference metric, were proposed and shown to be ghost free at the complete non-linear level. In this paper we consider these non-linear massive gravity actions but now formulated with a general reference metric. We extend the proof of the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost to this case. The analysis is carried out in the ADM formalism at the complete non-linear level. We show that in these models there always exists a Hamiltonian constraint which, with an associated secondary constraint, eliminates the ghost. This result considerably extends the range of known consistent non-linear massive gravity theories. In addition, these theories can also be used to describe a massive spin-2 field in an arbitrary, fixed gravitational background. We also discuss the positivity of the Hamiltonian.},

However, recently proposed theories of massive gravity have been shown to be ghost-free. These theories are formulated with respect to a flat, non-dynamical reference metric. In this work we show that it is possible to give dynamics to the reference metric in such a way that the consistency of the theory is maintained. The result is a non-linear bimetric theory of a massless spin-2 field interacting with a massive spin-2 field that is free of the Boulware-Deser ghost.

It introduces the basics of perturbative string theory, world-sheet supersymmetry, space-time supersymmetry, conformal field theory and the heterotic string, before describing modern developments, including D-branes, string dualities and M-theory. It then covers string geometry and flux compactifications, applications to cosmology and particle physics, black holes in string theory and M-theory, and the microscopic origin of black-hole entropy. It concludes with Matrix theory, the AdS/CFT duality and its generalizations. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in modern string theory, and will make an excellent textbook for a one-year course on string theory.

This corresponds to the leading quantum correction to the horizon entropy in string theory on the Rindler space. This entropy is also called the conical entropy and includes surface term contributions. We first derive a new simple formula of the conical entropy for any free higher spin fields. Then we apply this formula to computations of conical entropy in open and closed superstring. In our analysis of closed string, we study the twisted conical entropy defined by making use of string theory on Melvin backgrounds. This quantity is easier to calculate owing to the folding trick. Our analysis shows that the entanglement entropy in closed superstring is UV finite owing to the string scale cutoff.},

In the high temperature limit the ``exact'' expression for the entropy is regular but leads to a negative specific heat, thus implying an instability.

@article{Das1996Degrees,
	abstract = {We discuss two issues regarding the question of degrees of freedom in two dimensional string theory. The first issue relates to the classical limit of quantum string theory. In the classical theory one requires an infinite number of fields in addition to the collective field to describe ``folds'' on the fermi surface. We argue that in the quantum theory these are not additional degrees of freedom. Rather they represent quantum dispersions of the collective field which are \{\textbackslash em not\} suppressed when \$\textbackslash hbar \textbackslash rightarrow 0\$ whenever a fold is present, thus leading to a nontrivial classical limit. The second issue relates to the ultraviolet properties of the geometric entropy. We argue that the geometric entropy is finite in the ultraviolet due to \{\textbackslash em nonperturbative\} effects. This indicates that the true degrees of freedom of the two dimensional string at high energies is much smaller than what one naively expects.

@article{Maldacena1998The-Large,
	abstract = {We show that the large \$N\$ limit of certain conformal field theories in various dimensions include in their Hilbert space a sector describing supergravity on the product of Anti-deSitter spacetimes, spheres and other compact manifolds. This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large \$N\$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d \$\{\textbackslash cal N\} =4\$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings. We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-deSitter spacetimes are dual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for a definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compact dimensions.},

@article{Susskind1994The-World,
	abstract = {According to 't Hooft the combination of quantum mechanics and gravity requires the three dimensional world to be an image of data that can be stored on a two dimensional projection much like a holographic image. The two dimensional description only requires one discrete degree of freedom per Planck area and yet it is rich enough to describe all three dimensional phenomena. After outlining 't Hooft's proposal I give a preliminary informal description of how it may be implemented. One finds a basic requirement that particles must grow in size as their momenta are increased far above the Planck scale. The consequences for high energy particle collisions are described. The phenomena of particle growth with momentum was previously discussed in the context of string theory and was related to information spreading near black hole horizons. The considerations of this paper indicate that the effect is much more rapid at all but the earliest times. In fact the rate of spreading is found to saturate the bound from causality. Finally we consider string theory as a possible realization of 't Hooft's idea. The light front lattice string model of Klebanov and Susskind is reviewed and its similarities with the holographic theory are demonstrated. The agreement between the two requires unproven but plausible assumptions about the nonperturbative behavior of string theory. Very similar ideas to those in this paper have been long held by Charles Thorn.},

@article{t-Hooft1993Dimensional,
	abstract = {The requirement that physical phenomena associated with gravitational collapse should be duly reconciled with the postulates of quantum mechanics implies that at a Planckian scale our world is not 3+1 dimensional. Rather, the observable degrees of freedom can best be described as if they were Boolean variables defined on a two-dimensional lattice, evolving with time. This observation, deduced from not much more than unitarity, entropy and counting arguments, implies severe restrictions on possible models of quantum gravity. Using cellular automata as an example it is argued that this dimensional reduction implies more constraints than the freedom we have in constructing models. This is the main reason why so-far no completely consistent mathematical models of quantum black holes have been found. Essay dedicated to Abdus Salam.},

@misc{Ceplak2023The-Correspondence,
	abstract = {The correspondence principle between strings and black holes is a general framework for matching black holes and massive states of fundamental strings at a point where their physical properties (such as mass, entropy and temperature) smoothly agree with each other. This correspondence becomes puzzling when attempting to include rotation: At large enough spins, there exist degenerate string states that seemingly cannot be matched to any black hole. Conversely, there exist black holes with arbitrarily large spins that cannot correspond to any single-string state. We discuss in detail the properties of both types of objects and find that a correspondence that resolves the puzzles is possible by adding dynamical features and non-stationary configurations to the picture. Our scheme incorporates all black hole and string phases as part of the correspondence, save for one outlier which remains enigmatic: the near-extremal Kerr black hole. Along the way, we elaborate on general aspects of the correspondence that have not been emphasized before.},

	abstract = {In this Report we review the microscopic formulation of the five dimensional black hole of type IIB string theory in terms of the D1-D5 brane system. The emphasis here is more on the brane dynamics than on supergravity solutions. We show how the low energy brane dynamics, combined with crucial inputs from AdS/CFT correspondence, leads to a derivation of black hole thermodynamics and the rate of Hawking radiation. Our approach requires a detailed exposition of the gauge theory and conformal field theory of the D1-D5 system. We also discuss some applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence in the context of black hole formation in three dimensions by thermal transition and by collision of point particles.},

@article{De-Haro2020Conceptual,
	abstract = {The microscopic state counting of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\textbackslash "om black hole performed by Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa in 1996 has proven to be a central result in string theory. Here, with a philosophical readership in mind, the argument is presented in its contemporary context and its rather complex conceptual structure is analysed. In particular, we will identify the various inter-theoretic relations, such as duality and linkage relations, on which it depends. We further aim to make clear why the argument was immediately recognised as a successful accounting for the entropy of this black hole and how it engendered subsequent work that intended to strengthen the string theoretic analysis of black holes. Its relation to the formulation of the AdS/CFT conjecture will be briefly discussed, and the familiar reinterpretation of the entropy calculation in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence is given. Finally, we discuss the heuristic role that Strominger and Vafa's microscopic account of black hole entropy played for the black hole information paradox. A companion paper analyses the ontology of the Strominger-Vafa black hole states, the question of emergence of the black hole from a collection of D-branes, and the role of the correspondence principle in the context of string theory black holes.},

A formalism is developed for the calculation of {$\Gamma$} in the {$\alpha{'}$} \textrightarrow{} 0 limit. It is shown that in the case of closed Bose strings {$\Gamma$} contains the standard kinetic terms for the scalar, external metric and the antisymmetric tensor. Our approach makes possible a consistent formulation and solution of a ground state problem (including the problem of space-time compactification) in the string theory. We suggest a solution to the old ``tachyon problem'' based on the generation of non-trivial vacuum values for the scalar field, metric and antisymmetric tensor. It is shown that a preferred compactification in the closed Bose string theory is to three (anti-de Sitter) space-time dimensions.},

This 2007 text was the first dedicated to string cosmology, and contains a pedagogical introduction to the basic notions of the subject. It describes the possible scenarios suggested by string theory for the primordial evolution of our Universe. It discusses the main phenomenological consequences of these scenarios, stresses their differences from each other, and compares them to the more conventional models of inflation. The book summarises over 15 years of research in this field and introduces advances. It is self-contained, so it can be read by astrophysicists with no knowledge of string theory, and high-energy physicists with little understanding of cosmology. Detailed and explicit derivations of all the results presented provide a deeper appreciation of the subject.},

We analyse the equations of motion following from a Lagrangian quadratic in curvature and torsion, L = R2 + T2 + {$\lambda$}. The equations of motion are reduced to a system of equations for two scalar fields which in a particular case yields the Liouville equation. We have found and analysed stationary solutions with nontrivial torsion. It is proved that equations for extremals defining trajectories of pointlike spinless particles are completely integrable. A singularity of stationary space-time with nontrivial torsion has a repulsive character contrary to that of a black hole, and no particle can penetrate through it. Modification of the string theory due to the addition of the gravity Lagrangian is discussed.},

@article{Plefka2005Spinning,
	abstract = {In this introductory review we discuss dynamical tests of the AdS\_5 x S\^5 string/N=4 super Yang-Mills duality. After a brief introduction to AdS/CFT we argue that semiclassical string energies yield information on the quantum spectrum of the string in the limit of large angular momenta on the S\^5. The energies of the folded and circular spinning string solutions rotating on a S\^3 within the S\^5 are derived, which yield all loop predictions for the dual gauge theory scaling dimensions. These follow from the eigenvalues of the dilatation operator of N=4 super Yang-Mills in a minimal SU(2) subsector and we display its reformulation in terms of a Heisenberg s=1/2 spin chain along with the coordinate Bethe ansatz for its explicit diagonalization. In order to make contact to the spinning string energies we then study the thermodynamic limit of the one-loop gauge theory Bethe equations and demonstrate the matching with the folded and closed string result at this loop order. Finally the known gauge theory results at higher-loop orders are reviewed and the associated long-range spin chain Bethe ansatz is introduced, leading to an asymptotic all-loop conjecture for the gauge theory Bethe equations. This uncovers discrepancies at the three-loop order between gauge theory scaling dimensions and string theory energies and the implications of this are discussed. Along the way we comment on further developments and generalizations of the subject and point to the relevant literature.},

@article{Scherk1974aDual,
	abstract = {The possibility of describing particles other than hadrons (leptons, photons, gauge bosons, gravitons, etc.) by a dual model is explored. The Virasoro-Shapiro model is studied first, interpreting the massless spin-two state of the model as a graviton. We prove that in the limit of zero slope (with gvs2{$\alpha{'}$} held fixed) one obtains the Einstein theory of gravitation accompanied by a massless scalar field. Next, the Veneziano model is studied for small slope as an expansion in powers of {$\alpha{'}$}. It is known from previous work that the zeroth order term is precisely the Yang-Mills theory of a multiplet of massless vector bosons. We show that there are order {$\alpha{'}$} terms arising both from the dual tree and loop graphs. The former constitutes a relatively unimportant modification of the Yang-Mills theory, whereas the latter involves the coupling of the massless scalar and graviton states of the Virasoro-Shapiro model. Thus one may take the point of view that gravity arises as a unitarization effect in a dual unified theory of electromagnetism and weak interactions. In order to obtain the correct values for the electric charge and Newton's constant it is necessary that {$\alpha{'}$} - 10-34GeV-2The coupling of massless scalar states is also studied. \textcopyright{} 1974.},

The resulting equations are explicitly solved for the torsion and dilaton fields, and the remaining equations cast in a simple form. Previously unnoticed topological obstructions to solving these equations are found. The equations are shown to agree to leading order in perturbation theory with those derived in a field theory approach, provided one considers a more general ansatz than in previous analyses by allowing for a warp factor for the metric. Exact solutions with non-zero torsion are found, indicating a new class of finite sigma models. These solutions break the E{$\chi$} {$\otimes$} E{$\chi$} or SO(32) gauge group down to a large variety of subgroups. Orbifolds with torsion are constructed. A perturbative analysis of the equations indicates a class of solutions whose existence has been recently argued for on other grounds. Brief comments are made on the implications for phenomenology.},

	abstract = {The first part of this book gives a detailed, self-contained and mathematically rigorous exposition of classical conformal symmetry in n dimensions and its quantization in two dimensions. In particular, the conformal groups are determined and the appearance of the Virasoro algebra in the context of the quantization of two-dimensional conformal symmetry is explained via the classification of central extensions of Lie algebras and groups. The second part surveys some more advanced topics of conformal field theory, such as the representation theory of the Virasoro algebra, conformal symmetry within string theory, an axiomatic approach to Euclidean conformally covariant quantum field theory and a mathematical interpretation of the Verlinde formula in the context of moduli spaces of holomorphic vector bundles on a Riemann surface.
                The substantially revised and enlarged second edition makes in particular the second part of the book more self-contained and tutorial, with many more examples given. Furthermore, two new chapters on Wightman's axioms for quantum field theory and vertex algebras broaden the survey of advanced topics. An outlook making the connection with most recent developments has also been added.},

@article{Balthazar-t-backgrounds,
	abstract = {In perturbative string theory, one is generally interested in asymptotic observables, such as the S-matrix in flat spacetime, and boundary correlation functions in anti-de Sitter spacetime. However, there are backgrounds in which such observables do not exist. We study examples of such backgrounds in 1+1 dimensional string theory. In these examples, the Liouville wall accelerates and can become spacelike in the past and/or future. When that happens, the corresponding null infinity, at which the standard scattering states are defined, is shielded by the Liouville wall. We compute scattering and particle production amplitudes in these backgrounds in the region in parameter space where the wall remains timelike, and discuss the continuation of this picture to the spacelike regime. We also discuss the physics from the point of view of the dynamics of free fermions in backgrounds with a time-dependent Fermi surface.},

@mastersthesis{Blais2013A-new-quantization,
	abstract = {(2+1)-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant is a topological theory with no local degrees of freedom. When confined to compact universes which are topologically genus g Riemann surfaces times time, its classical phase space is the cotangent bundle of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. We consider the quantization of moduli space itself, emerging as the zero-momentum slice of this phase space. When a parity-violating ChernSimons term is added to the gravitational action, a nontrivial symplectic form is induced on this slice which is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson K¨ahler form. By demanding that this symplectic form integrate to 2π~ times an integer on every nontrivial two-cycle in moduli space---which is a necessary condition for the system to be quantizable---we find a new quantization condition on the Chern-Simons coupling k 0 . Our result strongly suggests that k 0 must be an integer multiple of 24 in order to define a self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.},

@article{Witten198821-Dimensional,
	abstract = {By disentangling the hamiltonian constraint equations, 2 + 1 dimensional gravity (with or without a cosmological constant) is shown to be exactly soluble at the classical and quantum levels. Indeed, it is closely related to Yang-Mills theory with purely the Chern-Simons action, which recently has turned out to define a soluble quantum field theory. 2 + 1 dimensional gravity has a straightforward renormalized perturbation expansion, with vanishing beta function. 2 + 1 dimensional quantum gravity may provide a testing ground for understanding the role of classical singularities in quantum mechanics, may be related to the discrete series of Virasoro representations in 1 + 1 dimensions, and may be a useful tool in studying three-dimensional geometry.},

@book{Carlip2003Quantum,
	abstract = {This timely volume provides a broad survey of (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity. It emphasises the 'quantum cosmology' of closed universes and the quantum mechanics of the (2+1)-dimensional black hole. It compares and contrasts a variety of approaches, and examines what they imply for a realistic theory of quantum gravity. General relativity in three spacetime dimensions has become a popular arena in which to explore the ramifications of quantum gravity. As a diffeomorphism-invariant theory of spacetime structure, this model shares many of the conceptual problems of realistic quantum gravity. But it is also simple enough that many programs of quantization can be carried out explicitly. After analysing the space of classical solutions, this book introduces some fifteen approaches to quantum gravity - from canonical quantization in York's 'extrinsic time' to Chern-Simons quantization, from the loop representation to covariant path integration to lattice methods. Relationships among quantizations are explored, as well as implications for such issues as topology change and the 'problem of time'. This book is an invaluable resource for all graduate students and researchers working in quantum gravity.},
