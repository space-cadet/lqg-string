@article{Brown2017The-Second,
	abstract = {We give arguments for the existence of a thermodynamics of
		  quantum complexity that includes a "Second Law of
		  Complexity". To guide us, we derive a correspondence
		  between the computational (circuit) complexity of a quantum
		  system of {\$}K{\$} qubits, and the positional entropy of a
		  related classical system with {\$}2{\^{}}K{\$} degrees of
		  freedom. We also argue that the kinetic entropy of the
		  classical system is equivalent to the Kolmogorov complexity
		  of the quantum Hamiltonian. We observe that the expected
		  pattern of growth of the complexity of the quantum system
		  parallels the growth of entropy of the classical system. We
		  argue that the property of having less-than-maximal
		  complexity (uncomplexity) is a resource that can be
		  expended to perform directed quantum computation. Although
		  this paper is not primarily about black holes, we find a
		  surprising interpretation of the uncomplexity-resource as
		  the accessible volume of spacetime behind a black hole
		  horizon.},

@article{Barbon2019Momentum/Complexity,
	abstract = {We establish a version of the Momentum/Complexity (PC) duality between the rate of operator complexity growth and a radial component of bulk momentum for a test system falling into a black hole. In systems of finite entropy, our map remains valid for arbitrarily late times after scrambling. The asymptotic regime of linear complexity growth is associated to a frozen momentum in the interior of the black hole, measured with respect to a time foliation by extremal codimension-one surfaces which saturate without reaching the singularity. The detailed analysis in this paper uses the Volume-Complexity (VC) prescription and an infalling system consisting of a thin shell of dust, but the final PC duality formula should have a much wider degree of generality.},

@article{Barbon2020Proof,
	abstract = {We show that the holographic Complexity = Volume proposal satisfies a very general notion of Momentum/Complexity correspondence (PC), based on the Momentum Constraint of General Relativity. It relates the rate of complexity variation with an appropriate matter momentum flux through spacelike extremal surfaces. This formalizes the intuitive idea that `gravitational clumpling' of matter increases complexity, and the required notion of `infall momentum' is shown to have a Newtonian avatar which expresses this idea. The proposed form of the PC correspondence is found to be exact for any solution of Einstein's equations in 2+1 dimensions, and any spherically symmetric solution in arbitrary dimensions, generalizing all previous calculations using spherical thin shells. Gravitational radiation enters through a correction which does not have a straightforward interpretation as a PC correspondence. Other obstructions to an exact PC duality have a topological origin and arise in the presence of wormholes.},

@article{Vaid2019Quantum,
	abstract = {Previous works (by Almiehri, Dong, Harlow, Pastakawski, Preskill, Yoshida and others) have established that quantum error correction plays an important role in understanding how the bulk degrees of freedom of an Anti-deSitter spacetime are encoded in the degrees of freedom of the boundary Conformal Field Theory. In previous work $\backslash$cite{\{}Vaid2013Elementary{\}} I have argued that the Bilson-Thompson model $\backslash$cite{\{}Bilson-Thompson2006Quantum,Vaid2010Embedding{\}} of elementary particles allows us to view elementary particles as gates for universal quantum computation. In the present work I show that the Bilson-Thompson model, where elementary particles are represented by elements of the framed braid group on three strands, provides an explicit model for the generation of qutrit (three-qubit) states which are the ingredients of Shor's quantum error correcting code. This allows, for the first time, to connect in a concrete manner the proposals of Almheiri, Pastawski, Preskill and others regarding the role of quantum error correction in quantum gravity, to a viable model of elementary particles. Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), the theory of quantum gravity in which such topological excitations exist, can thus serve as the glue which can connect AdS/CFT based approaches to quantum gravity to the well understood physics of the Standard Model.},

We show that the complexity functional can be written as the Polyakov action of two dimensional gravity or, equivalently, as the geometric action on the coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group. This way, we argue that gravity sets the rules for optimal quantum computation in conformal field theories.},

@article{Camargo2019Path,
	abstract = {Early efforts to understand complexity in field theory have primarily employed a geometric approach based on the concept of circuit complexity in quantum information theory. In a parallel vein, it has been proposed that certain deformations of the Euclidean path integral that prepares a given operator or state may provide an alternative definition, whose connection to the standard notion of complexity is less apparent. In this letter, we bridge the gap between these two proposals in two-dimensional conformal field theories, by explicitly showing how the latter approach from path integral optimization may be given a concrete realization within the standard gate counting framework. In particular, we show that when the background geometry is deformed by a Weyl rescaling, a judicious gate counting allows one to recover the Liouville action as a particular choice within a more general class of cost functions.},

@article{Takayanagi2018Holographic,
	abstract = {We propose that holographic spacetimes can be regarded as collections of quantum circuits based on path-integrals. We relate a codimension one surface in a gravity dual to a quantum circuit given by a path-integration on that surface with an appropriate UV cut off. Our proposal naturally generalizes the conjectured duality between the AdS/CFT and tensor networks. This largely strengthens the surface/state duality and also provides a holographic explanation of path-integral optimizations. For static gravity duals, our new framework provides a derivation of the holographic complexity formula given by the gravity action on the WDW patch. We also propose a new formula which relates numbers of quantum gates to surface areas, even including time-like surfaces, as a generalization of the holographic entanglement entropy formula. We argue the time component of the metric in AdS emerges from the density of unitary quantum gates in the dual CFT. Our proposal also provides a heuristic understanding how the gravitational force emerges from quantum circuits.},

@article{Freidel2010Twisted,
	abstract = {A cornerstone of the loop quantum gravity program is the
		  fact that the phase space of general relativity on a fixed
		  graph can be described by a product of {SU}(2) cotangent
		  bundles per edge. In this paper we show how to parametrize
		  this phase space in terms of quantities describing the
		  intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the triangulation dual
		  to the graph. These are defined by the assignment to each
		  triangle of its area, the two unit normals as seen from the
		  two polyhedra sharing it, and an additional angle related
		  to the extrinsic curvature. These quantities do not define
		  a Regge geometry, since they include extrinsic data, but a
		  looser notion of discrete geometry which is twisted in the
		  sense that it is locally well-defined, but the local
		  patches lack a consistent gluing among each other. We give
		  the Poisson brackets among the new variables, and exhibit a
		  symplectomorphism which maps them into the Poisson brackets
		  of loop gravity. The new parametrization has the advantage
		  of a simple description of the gauge-invariant reduced
		  phase space, which is given by a product of phase spaces
		  associated to edges and vertices, and it also provides an
		  abelianisation of the {SU}(2) connection. The results are
		  relevant for the construction of coherent states, and as a
		  byproduct, contribute to clarify the connection between
		  loop gravity and its subset corresponding to Regge
		  geometries.},

		  Gauge bosons and the fermions they act on are unified
		  together in the same algebra, as are the Lorentz

		  aims to unify everything into the algebra RxCxHxO. To set
		  the foundation, we show this to be the case for a single
		  generation of left-handed particles. In writing the theory
		  down, we are not building a vector space structure, and
		  then placing RxCxHxO numbers in as the components. On the
		  contrary, it is the vector spaces which come out of
		  RxCxHxO.},

	abstract = {We point out a somewhat mysterious appearance of
		  \$SU\_c(3)\$ representations, which exhibit the behaviour
		  of three full generations of standard model particles.
		  These representations are found in the Clifford algebra
		  \$\mathbb{C}l(6)\$, arising from the complex octonions. In
		  this paper, we explain how this 64-complex-dimensional
		  space comes about. With the algebra in place, we then
		  identify generators of \$SU(3)\$ within it. These \$SU(3)\$
		  generators then act to partition the remaining part of the
		  64-dimensional Clifford algebra into six triplets, six
		  singlets, and their antiparticles. That is, the algebra
		  mirrors the chromodynamic structure of exactly three
		  generations of the standard model's fermions. Passing from
		  particle to antiparticle, or vice versa, requires nothing
		  more than effecting the complex conjugate, \$*\$: \$i
		  \mapsto -i\$. The entire result is achieved using only the
		  eight-dimensional complex octonions as a single ingredient.},

@phdthesis{Furey2016Standard,
	abstract = {This thesis constitutes a first attempt to derive aspects
		  of standard model particle physics from little more than an
		  algebra. Here, we argue that physical concepts such as
		  particles, causality, and irreversible time may result from
		  the algebra acting on itself. We then focus on a special
		  case by considering the algebra
		  {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}\backslashotimes\backslashmathbb{\{}C{\}}\backslashotimes\backslashmathbb{\{}H{\}}\backslashotimes\backslashmathbb{\{}O{\}}{\$}.
		  Using nothing more than
		  {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}\backslashotimes\backslashmathbb{\{}C{\}}\backslashotimes\backslashmathbb{\{}H{\}}\backslashotimes\backslashmathbb{\{}O{\}}{\$}
		  acting on itself, we set out to find standard model
		  particle representations. From the complex quaternionic
		  portion of the algebra, we find generalized ideals, and
		  show that they describe concisely all of the Lorentz
		  representations of the standard model. From the complex
		  octonionic portion of the algebra, we find minimal left
		  ideals, and show that they mirror the behaviour of a
		  generation of quarks and leptons under {\$}su(3){\_}c{\$}
		  and {\$}u(1){\_}{\{}em{\}}{\$}. We then demonstrate a
		  rudimentary electroweak model which yields a
		  straightforward explanation as to why {\$}SU(2){\_}L{\$}
		  acts only on left-handed states. This holds in the case of
		  leptons. Finally, we demonstrate how
		  {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}C{\}}\backslashotimes\backslashmathbb{\{}O{\}}{\$}
		  can generate a
		  64-{\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}C{\}}{\$}-dimensional algebra,
		  wherein we find the {\$}SU(3){\_}c{\$} irreducible
		  representations corresponding to three generations of
		  quarks and leptons. We then conclude by showing how to arrive at all 48 electric charges.},

@article{Asselmeyer-Maluga2019Braids,
	abstract = {In this paper, we will describe a topological model for elementary particles based on 3-manifolds. Here, we will use Thurston's geometrization theorem to get a simple picture: fermions as hyperbolic knot complements (a complement {\$}C(K)=S{\^{}}{\{}3{\}}\backslashsetminus(K\backslashtimes D{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}){\$} of a knot {\$}K{\$} carrying a hyperbolic geometry) and bosons as torus bundles. In particular, hyperbolic 3-manifolds have a close connection to number theory (Bloch group, algebraic K-theory, quaternionic trace fields), which{\~{}}will be used in the description of fermions. Here, we choose the description of 3-manifolds by branched covers. Every 3-manifold can be described by a 3-fold branched cover of {\$}S{\^{}}{\{}3{\}}{\$} branched along a knot. In case of knot complements, one will obtain a 3-fold branched cover of the 3-disk {\$}D{\^{}}{\{}3{\}}{\$} branched along a 3-braid or 3-braids describing fermions. The whole approach will uncover new symmetries as induced by quantum and discrete groups. Using the Drinfeld--Turaev quantization, we will also construct a quantization so that quantum states correspond to knots. Particle properties like the electric charge must be expressed by topology, and we will obtain the right spectrum of possible values. Finally, we will get a connection to recent models of Furey, Stoica and Gresnigt using octonionic and quaternionic algebras with relations to 3-braids (Bilson--Thompson model).},

We then demonstrate a direct correspondence between this model and much of the known phenomenology of the Standard Model. In particular we identify the substructure of quarks, leptons and gauge bosons with elements of the braid group {\$}B{\_}3{\$}. Importantly, the preonic objects of this model require fewer assumed properties than in the Shupe/Harari model, yet more emergent quantities, such as helicity, hypercharge, and so on, are found. Simple topological processes are identified with electroweak interactions and conservation laws. The objects which play the role of preons in this model may occur as topological structures in a more comprehensive theory, and may themselves be viewed as composite, being formed of truly fundamental sub-components, representing exactly two levels of substructure within quarks and leptons.},

		  attachments correspond to the preons in Bilson-Thompson's

		  put together in a tiling to form more complex structures

		  We conclude with some speculations on the relation between

		  give any tree amplitude as a sum over terms constructed

		  multiplied by a Feynman propagator. The two amplitudes in
		  each term are physical, in the sense that all particles are
		  on-shell and momentum conservation is preserved. This is
		  striking, since it is just like adding certain
		  factorization limits of the original amplitude to build up
		  the full answer. As examples, we recompute all known
		  tree-level amplitudes of up to seven gluons and show that
		  our recursion relations naturally give their most compact
		  forms. We give a new result for an eight-gluon amplitude,
		  A(1+,2-,3+,4-,5+,6-,7+,8-). We show how to build any

@article{Feng2012An-Introduction,
	abstract = {This article provides an introduction to on-shell recursion relations for calculations of tree-level amplitudes. Starting with the basics, such as spinor notations and color decompositions, we expose analytic properties of gauge-boson amplitudes, BCFW-deformations, the large \$z\$-behavior of amplitudes, and on-shell recursion relations of gluons. We discuss further developments of on-shell recursion relations, including generalization to other quantum field theories, supersymmetric theories in particular, recursion relations for off-shell currents, recursion relation with nonzero boundary contributions, bonus relations, relations for rational parts of one-loop amplitudes, recursion relations in 3D and a proof of CSW rules. Finally, we present samples of applications, including solutions of split helicity amplitudes and of N= 4 SYM theories, consequences of consistent conditions under recursion relation, Kleiss-Kuijf (KK) and Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) relations for color-ordered gluon tree amplitudes, Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations.},

This suggests the existence of a new understanding for scattering amplitudes where locality and unitarity do not play a central role but are derived consequences from a different starting point. In this note we provide such an understanding for N=4 SYM scattering amplitudes in the planar limit, which we identify as ``the volume" of a new mathematical object--the Amplituhedron--generalizing the positive Grassmannian. Locality and unitarity emerge hand-in-hand from positive geometry.},

@misc{Loebbert2016Lectures,
	abstract = {In these introductory lectures we discuss the topic of Yangian symmetry from various perspectives. Forming the classical counterpart of the Yangian and an extension of ordinary Noether symmetries, first the concept of nonlocal charges in classical, two-dimensional field theory is reviewed. We then define the Yangian algebra following Drinfelds original motivation to construct solutions to the quantum YangBaxter equation. Different realizations of the Yangian and its mathematical role as a Hopf algebra and quantum group are discussed. We demonstrate how the Yangian algebra is implemented in quantum, two-dimensional field theories and how its generators are renormalized. Implications of Yangian symmetry on the two-dimensional scattering matrix are investigated. We furthermore consider the important case of discrete Yangian symmetry realized on integrable spin chains. Finally we give a brief introduction to Yangian symmetry in planar, four-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory and indicate its impact on the dilatation operator and treelevel scattering amplitudes. These lectures are illustrated by several examples, in particular the two-dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model, the Heisenberg spin chain and N = 4 superconformal YangMills theory in four dimensions.},

@article{Arkani-Hamed2017Scattering,
	abstract = {We introduce a formalism for describing four-dimensional scattering amplitudes for particles of any mass and spin. This naturally extends the familiar spinor-helicity formalism for massless particles to one where these variables carry an extra SU(2) little group index for massive particles, with the amplitudes for spin S particles transforming as symmetric rank 2S tensors. We systematically characterise all possible three particle amplitudes compatible with Poincare symmetry. Unitarity, in the form of consistent factorization, imposes algebraic conditions that can be used to construct all possible four-particle tree amplitudes. This also gives us a convenient basis in which to expand all possible four-particle amplitudes in terms of what can be called "spinning polynomials". Many general results of quantum field theory follow the analysis of four-particle scattering, ranging from the set of all possible consistent theories for massless particles, to spin-statistics, and the Weinberg-Witten theorem. We also find a transparent understanding for why massive particles of sufficiently high spin can not be "elementary". The Higgs and Super-Higgs mechanisms are naturally discovered as an infrared unification of many disparate helicity amplitudes into a smaller number of massive amplitudes, with a simple understanding for why this can't be extended to Higgsing for gravitons. We illustrate a number of applications of the formalism at one-loop, giving few-line computations of the electron (g-2) as well as the beta function and rational terms in QCD. "Off-shell" observables like correlation functions and form-factors can be thought of as scattering amplitudes with external "probe" particles of general mass and spin, so all these objects--amplitudes, form factors and correlators, can be studied from a common on-shell perspective.},

@article{Dvali2020Entropy,
	abstract = {We establish that unitarity of scattering amplitudes imposes universal entropy bounds. The maximal entropy of a self-sustained quantum field object of radius R is equal to its surface area and at the same time to the inverse running coupling evaluated at the scale R. The saturation of these entropy bounds is in one-to-one correspondence with the non-perturbative saturation of unitarity by 2-to-N particle scattering amplitudes at the point of optimal truncation. These bounds are more stringent than Bekenstein's bound and in a consistent theory all three get saturated simultaneously. This is true for all known entropy-saturating objects such as solitons, instantons, baryons, oscillons, black holes or simply lumps of classical fields. We refer to these collectively as "saturons" and show that in renormalizable theories they behave in all other respects like black holes. Finally, it is argued that the confinement in SU(N) gauge theory can be understood as a direct consequence of the entropy bounds and unitarity.},

	abstract = {We use the recently developed massive spinor-helicity formalism [1] of Arkani- Hamed et al. to propose a new class of recursion relations for tree-level amplitudes in gauge theories. These relations are based on a combined complex deformation of massless as well as massive external momenta. We use these relations to study tree-level amplitudes in scalar QCD as well as amplitudes involving massive vector bosons in the Higgsed phase of Yang-Mills theory. We prove the validity of our proposal by showing that in the limit of infinite momenta of two of the external particles, the amplitude once again is controlled by an enhanced Spin-Lorentz symmetry paralleling the proof of BCFW shift for massless gauge theories. Simple examples illustrate that the proposed shift may lead to an efficient computation of tree-level amplitudes.},
