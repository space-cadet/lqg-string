@article{Ashtekar1992Gravitons,
  abstract      = {The recently proposed loop representation, used previously to find exact solutions to the quantum constraints of general relativity, is here used to quantize linearized general relativity. The Fock space of graviton states and its associated algebra of observables are represented in terms of functionals of loops. The ``reality conditions'' are realized by an inner product that is chiral asymmetric, resulting in a chiral asymmetric ordering for the Hamiltonian and in an asymmetric description of the left and right handed gravitons. This chirally asymmetric formulation depends on a splitting of the linearized field into self-dual and anti-self dual parts rather than into positive and negative frequency parts; as the former, but not the latter, is meaningful away from flat backgrounds this is expected to be useful in connecting the nonperturbative theory to the linearized theory. The formalism depends on an arbitrary ``averaging'' function that controls certain divergences, but does not appear in the final physical quantities. Inspite of these somewhat unusual features, the loop quntization presented here is completely equivalent to the standard quantization of linearized gravity.},

@article{Rovelli1990Loop,
  abstract      = {We define a new representation for quantum general relativity, in which exact solutions of the quantum constraints may be obtained. The representation is constructed by means of a noncanonical graded Poisson algebra of classical observables, defined in terms of Ashtekar's new variables. The observables in this algebra are nonlocal and involve parallel transport around loops in a three-manifold {$\Sigma$}. The theory is quantized by constructing a linear representation of a deformation of this algebra. This representation is given in terms of an algebra of linear operators defined on a state space which consists of functionals of sets of loops in {$\Sigma$}. The construction is general and can be applied also to Yang-Mills theories. The diffeomorphism constraint is defined in terms of a natural representation of the diffeomorphism group. The hamiltonian constraint, which contains the dynamics of quantum gravity, is constructed as a limit of a sequence of observables which incorporates a regularization prescription. We give the general solution of the diffeomorphism constraint in closed form. It is spanned by a countable basis which is in one-to-one correspondence with the diffeomorphism equivalence classes of multiple loops, which are a generalization of the link classes studied in knot theory. Then we explicitly construct, in closed form, a large space of solution of the entire set of constraints, including the hamiltonian constraint. These turn out to be classified by the ordinary knot and link classes of {$\Sigma$}. The space of solutions that we find is a sector of the physical states space of nonperturbative quantum general relativity. The failure of perturbation theory is thus shown to be not relevant to the problem of the existence of a nontrivial physical state space in quantum gravity. The relationship between this new loop representation and the self-dual representation of Ashtekar is illuminated by means of a functional transform between states in the two representations. Questions of the completeness of the solution space, the meaning of the physical operators and the physical inner product, are discussed, but not, so far, resolved. {\copyright} 1990.},

  abstract      = {Area metrics and area metric backgrounds provide a unified framework for quantum gravity. They encode physical degrees of freedom beyond those of a metric. These non-metric degrees of freedom must be suppressed by a potential at sufficiently high energy scales to ensure that in the infrared regime classical gravity is recovered. On this basis, we first study necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for an area metric to be induced by a metric. Second, we consider candidate potentials for the area metric and point out a possible connection between the reduction of area metric geometry to metric geometry on the one hand, and the smallness of the cosmological constant on the other. Finally, we consider modifications of the Nambu-Goto action for a string, from a metric background to an area metric background. We demonstrate that area metric perturbations introduce an interaction corresponding to a singular vertex operator in the classically equivalent Polyakov action. The implications of these types of vertex operators for the quantum theory remain to be understood.},

  abstract      = {The Poincar{\textbackslash}'e gauge theory (PGT) of gravity provides a viable formulation of general relativity (Einstein-Cartan theory), and a popular model-building framework for modified gravity with torsion. Notoriously, however, the PGT terms which propagate vector torsion lead to strongly-coupled ghosts: the modern view is that only scalar torsion can propagate. To fix this, we revisit the concept of embedding explicit mass scales in scale-invariant theories, showing how the Klein-Gordon theory naturally leads to a slowly-rolling inflaton. We then show that the unique scale-invariant embedding of PGT leads to two new terms, one of which is the Maxwell term for vector torsion. We provide the full spectrum of quantum particles in the resulting theory. Our result means that every PGT is conformal and - after a two-decade hiatus - vector torsion is back on the menu.},

@misc{Gomes2022Same-Diff,
  abstract      = {The following questions are germane to our understanding of gauge-(in)variant quantities and physical possibility: how are gauge transformations and spacetime diffeomorphisms understood as symmetries, in which ways are they similar, and in which are they different? To what extent are we justified in endorsing different attitudes -- nowadays called sophistication, haecceitism, and eliminativism -- towards each? This is the first of four papers taking up this question. This first paper will discuss notions of symmetries and isomorphisms that will be used in the remaining papers in the series. There are several such notions in the literature and the question of how they mesh with empirical discernibility is a delicate one; even the orthodox view that symmetries are empirically unobservable (even in principle) has recently been challenged by Belot. Focusing on local field theories, I will provide a precise definition of dynamical symmetries in terms of the space of states of the theory at hand. I will then apply the definition to Yang-Mills theories and general relativity and show that these symmetries correspond to automorphisms of `natural' geometric structures: the small diffeomorphisms of the spacetime manifold and the small fiber-preserving diffeomorphisms of a fibered space. Finally, I will show that these automorphisms can be given a passive gloss, since they correspond 1-1 to the coordinate transformations of the underlying manifolds.},

Bulk notions such as Bogoliubov transformations, location in the radial direction, and the holographic entropy bound all have natural CFT interpretations in the language of quantum error correction. We also show that the question of whether bulk operator reconstruction works only in the causal wedge or all the way to the extremal surface is related to the question of whether or not the quantum error correcting code realized by AdS/CFT is also a "quantum secret sharing scheme", and suggest a tensor network calculation that may settle the issue. Interestingly, the version of quantum error correction which is best suited to our analysis is the somewhat nonstandard "operator algebra quantum error correction" of Beny, Kempf, and Kribs. Our proposal gives a precise formulation of the idea of "subregion-subregion" duality in AdS/CFT, and clarifies the limits of its validity.},

  abstract      = {We propose a family of exactly solvable toy models for the AdS/CFT correspondence based on a novel construction of quantum error-correcting codes with a tensor network structure. Our building block is a special type of tensor with maximal entanglement along any bipartition, which gives rise to an isometry from the bulk Hilbert space to the boundary Hilbert space. The entire tensor network is an encoder for a quantum error-correcting code, where the bulk and boundary degrees of freedom may be identified as logical and physical degrees of freedom respectively. These models capture key features of entanglement in the AdS/CFT correspondence; in particular, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the negativity of tripartite information are obeyed exactly in many cases. That bulk logical operators can be represented on multiple boundary regions mimics the Rindler-wedge reconstruction of boundary operators from bulk operators, realizing explicitly the quantum error-correcting features of AdS/CFT recently proposed by Almheiri et. al in arXiv:1411.7041.},

Their properties are similar to those of supersymmetric generalizations which can be solved by the AdS/CFT correspondence; the low energy limit of the latter models is described by a AdS2 geometry. Then I turn to Kondo lattice models, which can be described by a mean- field theory obtained by a mapping to a quantum impurity coupled to a self-consistent environment. Such a theory yields a 'fractionalized Fermi liquid' phase of conduction electrons coupled to a critical spin liquid state, and is an attractive mean-field theory of strange metals. The recent holographic description of strange metals with a AdS2 x R2 geometry is argued to be related to such mean-field solutions of Kondo lattice models.},

@article{Guica2009The-Kerr/CFT,
  abstract      = {Quantum gravity in the region very near the horizon of an extreme Kerr black hole (whose angular momentum and mass are related by J=GM{\textasciicircum}2) is considered. It is shown that consistent boundary conditions exist, for which the asymptotic symmetry generators form one copy of the Virasoro algebra with central charge c\_L=12J / {\textbackslash}hbar. This implies that the near-horizon quantum states can be identified with those of (a chiral half of) a two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). Moreover, in the extreme limit, the Frolov-Thorne vacuum state reduces to a thermal density matrix with dimensionless temperature T\_L=1/2{\textbackslash}pi and conjugate energy given by the zero mode generator, L\_0, of the Virasoro algebra. Assuming unitarity, the Cardy formula then gives a microscopic entropy S\_\{micro\}=2{\textbackslash}pi J / {\textbackslash}hbar for the CFT, which reproduces the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S\_\{macro\}=Area / 4{\textbackslash}hbar G. The results apply to any consistent unitary quantum theory of gravity with a Kerr solution.

The non-critical string theory is related to critical string theory in anti-deSitter background. We introduce a boundary of the anti-deSitter space analogous to a cut-off on the Liouville coordinate of the two-dimensional string theory. Correlation functions of operators in the gauge theory are related to the dependence of the supergravity action on the boundary conditions. From the quadratic terms in supergravity we read off the anomalous dimensions. For operators that couple to massless string states it has been established through absorption calculations that the anomalous dimensions vanish, and we rederive this result. The operators that couple to massive string states at level n acquire anomalous dimensions that grow as 2 ng Y M {\textsurd} 2N 1/2 for large 't Hooft coupling.

@article{Witten1998Anti,
  abstract      = {Recently, it has been proposed by Maldacena that large \$N\$ limits of certain conformal field theories in \$d\$ dimensions can be described in terms of supergravity (and string theory) on the product of \$d+1\$-dimensional \$AdS\$ space with a compact manifold. Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on \$AdS\_5{\textbackslash}times \{{\textbackslash}bf S\}{\textasciicircum}5\$ match with the chiral operators of \${\textbackslash}N=4\$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions, one can deduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the \${\textbackslash}N=4\$ theory has a large \$N\$ phase transition related to the thermodynamics of \$AdS\$ black holes.},

@article{Ashtekar1987New,
  abstract      = {The phase space of general relativity is first extended in a standard manner to incorporate spinors. New coordinates are then introduced on this enlarged phase space to simplify the structure of constraint equations. Now, the basic variables, satisfying the canonical Poisson-brackets relations, are the (density-valued) soldering forms {\~undefined} a A B and certain spin-connection one-forms AaA B. Constraints of Einstein's theory simply state that {\~undefined} a satisfies the Gauss law constraint with respect to Aa and that the curvature tensor FabA B and Aa satisfies certain purely algebraic conditions (involving {\~undefined} a). In particular, the constraints are at worst quadratic in the new variables {\~undefined} a and Aa. This is in striking contrast with the situation with traditional variables, where constraints contain nonpolynomial functions of the three-metric. Simplification occurs because Aa has information about both the three-metric and its conjugate momentum. In the four-dimensional space-time picture, Aa turns out to be a potential for the self-dual part of Weyl curvature. An important feature of the new form of constraints is that it provides a natural embedding of the constraint surface of the Einstein phase space into that of Yang-Mills phase space. This embedding provides new tools to analyze a number of issues in both classical and quantum gravity. Some illustrative applications are discussed. Finally, the (Poisson-bracket) algebra of new constraints is computed. The framework sets the stage for another approach to canonical quantum gravity, discussed in forthcoming papers also by Jacobson, Lee, Renteln, and Smolin.},

@misc{Cheung2024Generalized,
  abstract      = {We explore generalized symmetry in the context of nonlinear dynamical gravity. Our basic strategy is to transcribe known results from Yang-Mills theory directly to gravity via the tetrad formalism, which recasts general relativity as a gauge theory of the local Lorentz group. By analogy, we deduce that gravity exhibits a one-form symmetry implemented by an operator \$U\_{\textbackslash}alpha\$ labeled by a center element \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ of the Lorentz group and associated with a certain area measured in Planck units. The corresponding charged line operator \$W\_{\textbackslash}rho\$ is the holonomy in a spin representation \${\textbackslash}rho\$, which is the gravitational analog of a Wilson loop. The topological linking of \$U\_{\textbackslash}alpha\$ and \$W\_{\textbackslash}rho\$ has an elegant physical interpretation from classical gravitation: the former materializes an exotic chiral cosmic string defect whose quantized conical deficit angle is measured by the latter. We verify this claim explicitly in an AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. Notably, our conclusions imply that the standard model exhibits a new symmetry of nature at scales below the lightest neutrino mass. More generally, the absence of global symmetries in quantum gravity suggests that the gravitational one-form symmetry is either gauged or explicitly broken. The latter mandates the existence of fermions. Finally, we comment on generalizations to magnetic higher-form or higher-group gravitational symmetries.},

  abstract      = {The configuration of typical highly excited (M {$>>$} M\_s {\textasciitilde} (alpha')\^{}\{-1/2\}) string states is considered as the string coupling g is adiabatically increased. The size distribution of very massive single string states is studied and the mass shift, due to long-range gravitational, dilatonic and axionic attraction, is estimated. By combining the two effects, in any number of spatial dimensions d, the most probable size of a string state becomes of order l\_s = sqrt\{2 alpha'\} when g\^{}2 M / M\_s {\textasciitilde} 1. Depending on the dimension d, the transition between a random-walk-size string state (for low g) and a compact ({\textasciitilde} l\_s) string state (when g\^{}2 M / M\_s {\textasciitilde} 1) can be very gradual (d=3), fast but continuous (d=4), or discontinuous (d {$>$} 4). Those compact string states look like nuggets of an ultradense state of string matter, with energy density rho {\textasciitilde} g\^{}\{-2\} M\_s\^{}\{d+1\}. Our results extend and clarify previous work by Susskind, and by Horowitz and Polchinski, on the correspondence between self-gravitating string states and black holes.},

The string dynamics in cosmological and black hole spacetimes is investigated.The methods to solve the string equations of motion in curved spacetimes are described.That is, the perturbation approach, the null approach, the \${\textbackslash}tau\$-expansion, and the construction of global solutions.The behaviour of strings in FRW and inflatio- nary spacetimes is obtained from the various types of string solutions. Three different types of behaviour appear:\{{\textbackslash}bf unstable, dual\} to unstable and \{{\textbackslash}bf stable\}.For the unstable strings, the energy and size grow proportional to \$R\$ for large scale factors \$R {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}infty\$. For the dual to unstable strings, the energy and size blow up for R{\textbackslash}to 0 as 1/R. For stable strings, the energy and size are bounded. (In Minkowski, all solutions are of the stable type). The self-consistent solution to the Einstein equations for string dominated universes is reviewed. The energy-momentum tensor for a gas of strings is taken as source and from the above behaviours the string equation of state is \{{\textbackslash}bf derived\}. The self-consistent string solution exhibits realistic matter dominated behaviour for large times and radiation dominated behaviour for early times. We report on the \{{\textbackslash}bf exact integrability\} of the string dynamics in de Sitter spacetime that allows to systematically find \{{\textbackslash}bf exact\} string solutions by soliton methods. \{{\textbackslash}bf Multistring solutions\} are a new feature in curved spacetimes. That is, a single world-sheet simultaneously describes many different and independent strings. This phenomenon has no analogue in flat spacetime and follows from the coupling of the strings with the geometry. Finally, the string dynamics next and inside a Schwarzschild black hole is analyzed and their physical properties discussed.},

  abstract      = {A concrete model of extracting the physics from the bulk of a gravitational universe is important to the study of quantum gravity and its possible relationship with experiments. Such a model can be constructed in the AdS/CFT correspondence by gluing a bath on the asymptotic boundary of the bulk anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. This bath models a laboratory and is described by a quantum field theory. In the dual conformal field theory (CFT) description this coupling is achieved by a double-trace deformation that couples the CFT with the bath. This suggests that the physics observed by the laboratory is fully unitary. In this paper, we analyze the quantum aspects of this model in detail which conveys new lessons about the AdS/CFT correspondence, and we discuss the potential usefulness of this model in understanding subregion physics in a gravitational universe.},

@article{Hassan2012Ghostfree,
  abstract      = {Theories of massive gravity inevitably include an auxiliary reference metric. Generically, they also contain an inconsistency known as the Boulware-Deser ghost. Recently, a family of non-linear massive gravity actions, formulated with a flat reference metric, were proposed and shown to be ghost free at the complete non-linear level. In this paper we consider these non-linear massive gravity actions but now formulated with a general reference metric. We extend the proof of the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost to this case. The analysis is carried out in the ADM formalism at the complete non-linear level. We show that in these models there always exists a Hamiltonian constraint which, with an associated secondary constraint, eliminates the ghost. This result considerably extends the range of known consistent non-linear massive gravity theories. In addition, these theories can also be used to describe a massive spin-2 field in an arbitrary, fixed gravitational background. We also discuss the positivity of the Hamiltonian.},

Duality invariance can be restored by enlarging the phase space of the theory to allow for violations of the algebraic Bianchi identity. We show that in cases where the matter content can be understood as a component of the torsion tensor duality can be restored and we compute the corresponding duality current. We consider the case of NS-NS gravity as an example and find that the duality current is given by the divergence of the axion. In the linearized approximation of the low energy heterotic string theory these results imply that duality of the generalized Riemann curvature tensor implements Riemannian, axion-dilaton and electro-magnetic dualities simultaneously.},

@article{Rosen1940General,
  abstract      = {Within the framework of the general theory of relativity, it is proposed to introduce at each point of space-time a Euclidean metric tensor {$\gamma\mu\nu$} in addition to the usual Riemannian metric tensor g{$\mu\nu$}. In this way one imparts tensor character to quantities which in the usual form of the theory do not have it. For example, one can obtain a gravitational energy-momentum density tensor in place of the usual pseudo-tensor. Furthermore one can impose four additional covariant conditions on the gravitational field and thus restrict the form of the solution for the field corresponding to a given physical situation.},

@article{Lust2021Extracting,
  abstract      = {The origin of the graviton from string theory is well understood: it corresponds to a massless state in closed string spectra, whose low-energy effective action, as extracted from string scattering amplitudes, is that of Einstein-Hilbert. In this work, we explore the possibility of such a string-theoretic emergence of ghost-free bimetric theory, a recently proposed theory that involves two dynamical metrics, that around particular backgrounds propagates the graviton and a massive spin-2 field, which has been argued to be a viable dark matter candidate. By choosing to identify the latter with a massive spin-2 state of open string spectra, we compute tree-level three-point string scattering amplitudes that describe interactions of the massive spin-2 with itself and with the graviton. With the mass of the external legs depending on the string scale, we discover that extracting the corresponding low-energy effective actions in four spacetime dimensions is a subtle but consistent process and proceed to appropriately compare them with bimetric theory. Our findings consist in establishing that string and bimetric theory provide to lowest order the same set of two-derivative terms describing the interactions of the massive spin-2 with itself and with the graviton, albeit up to numerical coefficient discrepancies, a fact that we analyze and interpret. We conclude with a mention of future investigations.},

  abstract      = {We put forward a two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model that couples (bosonic) matter fields to topological Horava gravity on a nonrelativistic worldsheet. In the target space, this sigma model describes classical strings propagating in a curved spacetime background, whose geometry is described by two distinct metric fields. We evaluate the renormalization group flows of this sigma model on a flat worldsheet and derive a set of beta-functionals for the bimetric fields. Imposing worldsheet Weyl invariance at the quantum level, we uncover a set of gravitational field equations that dictate the dynamics of the bimetric fields in the target space, where a unique massless spin-two excitation emerges. When the bimetric fields become identical, the sigma model gains an emergent Lorentz symmetry. In this single metric limit, the beta-functionals of the bimetric fields reduce to the Ricci flow equation that arises in bosonic string theory, and the bimetric gravitational field equations give rise to Einstein's gravity.},

@article{Hassan2012Ghost-Free,
  abstract      = {Theories of massive gravity inevitably include an auxiliary reference metric. Generically, they also contain an inconsistency known as the Boulware-Deser ghost. Recently, a family of non-linear massive gravity actions, formulated with a flat reference metric, were proposed and shown to be ghost free at the complete non-linear level. In this paper we consider these non-linear massive gravity actions but now formulated with a general reference metric. We extend the proof of the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost to this case. The analysis is carried out in the ADM formalism at the complete non-linear level. We show that in these models there always exists a Hamiltonian constraint which, with an associated secondary constraint, eliminates the ghost. This result considerably extends the range of known consistent non-linear massive gravity theories. In addition, these theories can also be used to describe a massive spin-2 field in an arbitrary, fixed gravitational background. We also discuss the positivity of the Hamiltonian.},

This entropy is also called the conical entropy and includes surface term contributions. We first derive a new simple formula of the conical entropy for any free higher spin fields. Then we apply this formula to computations of conical entropy in open and closed superstring. In our analysis of closed string, we study the twisted conical entropy defined by making use of string theory on Melvin backgrounds. This quantity is easier to calculate owing to the folding trick.

In terms of the corresponding collective field theory this is a \{\textbackslash em nonperturbative\} effect and is related to the soft behaviour of the usual thermodynamic entropy at high temperatures. We then show that thermodynamic entropy of the singlet sector of the one dimensional matrix model at high temperatures is governed by nonperturbative effects of the underlying string theory. In the high temperature limit the ``exact'' expression for the entropy is regular but leads to a negative specific heat, thus implying an instability. We speculate that in a properly defined two dimensional string theory, the thermodynamic entropy could approach a constant at high temperatures and lead to a geometric entropy which is finite in the ultraviolet.},

@article{Das1996Degrees,
  abstract      = {We discuss two issues regarding the question of degrees of freedom in two dimensional string theory. The first issue relates to the classical limit of quantum string theory. In the classical theory one requires an infinite number of fields in addition to the collective field to describe ``folds'' on the fermi surface. We argue that in the quantum theory these are not additional degrees of freedom. Rather they represent quantum dispersions of the collective field which are \{\textbackslash em not\} suppressed when \$\textbackslash hbar \textbackslash rightarrow 0\$ whenever a fold is present, thus leading to a nontrivial classical limit. The second issue relates to the ultraviolet properties of the geometric entropy. We argue that the geometric entropy is finite in the ultraviolet due to \{\textbackslash em nonperturbative\} effects. This indicates that the true degrees of freedom of the two dimensional string at high energies is much smaller than what one naively expects.

Entanglement entropy is a powerful diagnostic of locality, because locality leads to a large amount of short distance entanglement. Two dimensional string theory is among the very simplest instances of an emergent spatial dimension. We compute the entanglement entropy in the large \$N\$ matrix quantum mechanics dual to two dimensional string theory, in the semiclassical limit of weak string coupling. We isolate a logarithmically large, but finite, contribution that corresponds to the short distance entanglement of the tachyon field in the emergent spacetime. From the spacetime point of view, the entanglement is regulated by a nonperturbative `graininess' of space.},

This requires that gravitational lensing by matter energy distorts the causal structure of spacetime in just such a way that the Einstein equation holds.

This perspective suggests that it may be no more appropriate to canonically quantize the Einstein equation than it would be to quantize the wave equation for sound in air.},

  abstract      = {Intrinsic and extrinsic geometric properties of string world sheets in curved space-time background are explored. In our formulation, the only dynamical degrees of freedom of the string are its immersion coordinates. Classical equation of motion and the space-time energy-momentum tensor of the string are obtained. The equations of motion for the extrinsic curvature action are second order for the scalar mean curvature of the world sheet. 1-loop divergent terms are calculated using the background field method. Asymptotic freedom of the extrinsic curvature coupling is established.},

@article{Maldacena1998The-Large,
  abstract      = {We show that the large \$N\$ limit of certain conformal field theories in various dimensions include in their Hilbert space a sector describing supergravity on the product of Anti-deSitter spacetimes, spheres and other compact manifolds. This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large \$N\$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d \$\{\textbackslash cal N\} =4\$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings. We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-deSitter spacetimes are dual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for a definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compact dimensions.},

@article{Susskind1994The-World,
  abstract      = {According to 't Hooft the combination of quantum mechanics and gravity requires the three dimensional world to be an image of data that can be stored on a two dimensional projection much like a holographic image. The two dimensional description only requires one discrete degree of freedom per Planck area and yet it is rich enough to describe all three dimensional phenomena. After outlining 't Hooft's proposal I give a preliminary informal description of how it may be implemented. One finds a basic requirement that particles must grow in size as their momenta are increased far above the Planck scale. The consequences for high energy particle collisions are described. The phenomena of particle growth with momentum was previously discussed in the context of string theory and was related to information spreading near black hole horizons. The considerations of this paper indicate that the effect is much more rapid at all but the earliest times. In fact the rate of spreading is found to saturate the bound from causality. Finally we consider string theory as a possible realization of 't Hooft's idea. The light front lattice string model of Klebanov and Susskind is reviewed and its similarities with the holographic theory are demonstrated. The agreement between the two requires unproven but plausible assumptions about the nonperturbative behavior of string theory. Very similar ideas to those in this paper have been long held by Charles Thorn.},

@article{t-Hooft1993Dimensional,
  abstract      = {The requirement that physical phenomena associated with gravitational collapse should be duly reconciled with the postulates of quantum mechanics implies that at a Planckian scale our world is not 3+1 dimensional. Rather, the observable degrees of freedom can best be described as if they were Boolean variables defined on a two-dimensional lattice, evolving with time. This observation, deduced from not much more than unitarity, entropy and counting arguments, implies severe restrictions on possible models of quantum gravity. Using cellular automata as an example it is argued that this dimensional reduction implies more constraints than the freedom we have in constructing models. This is the main reason why so-far no completely consistent mathematical models of quantum black holes have been found. Essay dedicated to Abdus Salam.},

  abstract   = {We study the problem of finding the beta functions, and the associated spacetime effective action, for interacting open and closed strings propagating in background fields. String loop divergences play a crucial role in this problem. Cancelling them against sigma model divergences gives a consistent set of loop-corrected beta functions, which can be derived from a simple generalization of the string-tree-level effective action. This suggests the existence of new string theories which are conformally invariant only after all world sheets have been summed.},

@misc{Ceplak2023The-Correspondence,
  abstract      = {The correspondence principle between strings and black holes is a general framework for matching black holes and massive states of fundamental strings at a point where their physical properties (such as mass, entropy and temperature) smoothly agree with each other. This correspondence becomes puzzling when attempting to include rotation: At large enough spins, there exist degenerate string states that seemingly cannot be matched to any black hole. Conversely, there exist black holes with arbitrarily large spins that cannot correspond to any single-string state. We discuss in detail the properties of both types of objects and find that a correspondence that resolves the puzzles is possible by adding dynamical features and non-stationary configurations to the picture. Our scheme incorporates all black hole and string phases as part of the correspondence, save for one outlier which remains enigmatic: the near-extremal Kerr black hole. Along the way, we elaborate on general aspects of the correspondence that have not been emphasized before.},

We show how the low energy brane dynamics, combined with crucial inputs from AdS/CFT correspondence, leads to a derivation of black hole thermodynamics and the rate of Hawking radiation. Our approach requires a detailed exposition of the gauge theory and conformal field theory of the D1-D5 system.

@article{De-Haro2020Conceptual,
  abstract      = {The microscopic state counting of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\textbackslash "om black hole performed by Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa in 1996 has proven to be a central result in string theory. Here, with a philosophical readership in mind, the argument is presented in its contemporary context and its rather complex conceptual structure is analysed. In particular, we will identify the various inter-theoretic relations, such as duality and linkage relations, on which it depends. We further aim to make clear why the argument was immediately recognised as a successful accounting for the entropy of this black hole and how it engendered subsequent work that intended to strengthen the string theoretic analysis of black holes. Its relation to the formulation of the AdS/CFT conjecture will be briefly discussed, and the familiar reinterpretation of the entropy calculation in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence is given. Finally, we discuss the heuristic role that Strominger and Vafa's microscopic account of black hole entropy played for the black hole information paradox. A companion paper analyses the ontology of the Strominger-Vafa black hole states, the question of emergence of the black hole from a collection of D-branes, and the role of the correspondence principle in the context of string theory black holes.},

A formalism is developed for the calculation of {$\Gamma$} in the {$\alpha{'}$} \textrightarrow{} 0 limit. It is shown that in the case of closed Bose strings {$\Gamma$} contains the standard kinetic terms for the scalar, external metric and the antisymmetric tensor. Our approach makes possible a consistent formulation and solution of a ground state problem (including the problem of space-time compactification) in the string theory. We suggest a solution to the old ``tachyon problem'' based on the generation of non-trivial vacuum values for the scalar field, metric and antisymmetric tensor. It is shown that a preferred compactification in the closed Bose string theory is to three (anti-de Sitter) space-time dimensions.},

This 2007 text was the first dedicated to string cosmology, and contains a pedagogical introduction to the basic notions of the subject. It describes the possible scenarios suggested by string theory for the primordial evolution of our Universe. It discusses the main phenomenological consequences of these scenarios, stresses their differences from each other, and compares them to the more conventional models of inflation. The book summarises over 15 years of research in this field and introduces advances. It is self-contained, so it can be read by astrophysicists with no knowledge of string theory, and high-energy physicists with little understanding of cosmology. Detailed and explicit derivations of all the results presented provide a deeper appreciation of the subject.},

We suggest, thus, that the MTs are the microsites, in the brain, for the emergence of stable, macroscopic quantum coherent states, identifiable with the \{\textbackslash em preconscious states\}. Quantum space-time effects, as described by non-critical string theory, trigger then an \{\textbackslash em organized collapse\} of the coherent states down to a specific or \{\textbackslash em conscious state\}. The whole process we estimate to take \$\{\textbackslash cal O\}(1\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm sec\})\$, in excellent agreement with a plethora of experimental/observational findings. The \{\textbackslash em microscopic arrow of time\}, endemic in non-critical string theory, and apparent here in the self-collapse process, provides a satisfactory and simple resolution to the age-old problem of how the, central to our feelings of awareness, sensation of the progression of time is generated.},

@article{Plefka2005Spinning,
  abstract      = {In this introductory review we discuss dynamical tests of the AdS\_5 x S\^5 string/N=4 super Yang-Mills duality. After a brief introduction to AdS/CFT we argue that semiclassical string energies yield information on the quantum spectrum of the string in the limit of large angular momenta on the S\^5. The energies of the folded and circular spinning string solutions rotating on a S\^3 within the S\^5 are derived, which yield all loop predictions for the dual gauge theory scaling dimensions. These follow from the eigenvalues of the dilatation operator of N=4 super Yang-Mills in a minimal SU(2) subsector and we display its reformulation in terms of a Heisenberg s=1/2 spin chain along with the coordinate Bethe ansatz for its explicit diagonalization. In order to make contact to the spinning string energies we then study the thermodynamic limit of the one-loop gauge theory Bethe equations and demonstrate the matching with the folded and closed string result at this loop order. Finally the known gauge theory results at higher-loop orders are reviewed and the associated long-range spin chain Bethe ansatz is introduced, leading to an asymptotic all-loop conjecture for the gauge theory Bethe equations. This uncovers discrepancies at the three-loop order between gauge theory scaling dimensions and string theory energies and the implications of this are discussed. Along the way we comment on further developments and generalizations of the subject and point to the relevant literature.},

The next three chapters treat string interactions: the general formalism, and detailed treatments of the tree level and one loop amplitudes. Chapter eight covers toroidal compactification and many important aspects of string physics, such as T-duality and D-branes. Chapter nine treats higher-order amplitudes, including an analysis of their finiteness and unitarity, and various nonperturbative ideas. An appendix giving a short course on path integral methods is included. This is an essential text and reference for graduate students and researchers interested in modern superstring theory.},

@article{Scherk1974aDual,
  abstract      = {The possibility of describing particles other than hadrons (leptons, photons, gauge bosons, gravitons, etc.) by a dual model is explored. The Virasoro-Shapiro model is studied first, interpreting the massless spin-two state of the model as a graviton. We prove that in the limit of zero slope (with gvs2{$\alpha{'}$} held fixed) one obtains the Einstein theory of gravitation accompanied by a massless scalar field. Next, the Veneziano model is studied for small slope as an expansion in powers of {$\alpha{'}$}. It is known from previous work that the zeroth order term is precisely the Yang-Mills theory of a multiplet of massless vector bosons. We show that there are order {$\alpha{'}$} terms arising both from the dual tree and loop graphs. The former constitutes a relatively unimportant modification of the Yang-Mills theory, whereas the latter involves the coupling of the massless scalar and graviton states of the Virasoro-Shapiro model. Thus one may take the point of view that gravity arises as a unitarization effect in a dual unified theory of electromagnetism and weak interactions. In order to obtain the correct values for the electric charge and Newton's constant it is necessary that {$\alpha{'}$} - 10-34GeV-2The coupling of massless scalar states is also studied. \textcopyright{} 1974.},

The resulting equations are explicitly solved for the torsion and dilaton fields, and the remaining equations cast in a simple form. Previously unnoticed topological obstructions to solving these equations are found. The equations are shown to agree to leading order in perturbation theory with those derived in a field theory approach, provided one considers a more general ansatz than in previous analyses by allowing for a warp factor for the metric. Exact solutions with non-zero torsion are found, indicating a new class of finite sigma models. These solutions break the E{$\chi$} {$\otimes$} E{$\chi$} or SO(32) gauge group down to a large variety of subgroups. Orbifolds with torsion are constructed. A perturbative analysis of the equations indicates a class of solutions whose existence has been recently argued for on other grounds. Brief comments are made on the implications for phenomenology.},

  abstract      = {Three postulates asserting the validity of conventional quantum theory, semi-classical general relativity and the statistical basis for thermodynamics are introduced as a foundation for the study of black hole evolution. We explain how these postulates may be implemented in a ``stretched horizon'' or membrane description of the black hole, appropriate to a distant observer. The technical analysis is illustrated in the simplified context of 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity. Our postulates imply that the dissipative properties of the stretched horizon arise from a course graining of microphysical degrees of freedom that the horizon must possess. A principle of black hole complementarity is advocated. The overall viewpoint is similar to that pioneered by 't\textasciitilde Hooft but the detailed implementation is different.},

The first paper gives a conceptual analysis of the Strominger-Vafa argument, and of several research efforts that it engendered. In this paper, we assess whether the black hole should be considered as emergent from the D-brane system, particularly in light of the role that duality plays in the argument. We further identify uses of the quantum-to-classical correspondence principle in string theory discussions of black holes, and compare these to the heuristics of earlier efforts in theory construction, in particular those of the old quantum theory.},

@article{Afshordi-emergent,
  abstract   = {Changing the dimensionality of the space-time at the smallest and largest distances has manifold theoretical advantages. If the space is lower dimensional in the high energy regime, then there are no ultraviolet divergencies in field theories, it is possible to quantize gravity, and the theory of matter plus gravity is free of divergencies or renormalizable. If the space is higher dimensional at cosmological scales, then some cosmological problems (including the cosmological constant problem) can be attacked from a completely new perspective. In this paper, we construct an explicit model of "evolving dimensions" in which the dimensions open up as the temperature of the universe drops. We adopt the string theory framework in which the dimensions are fields that live on the string worldsheet, and add temperature dependent mass terms for them. At the Big Bang, all the dimensions are very heavy and are not excited. As the universe cools down, dimensions open up one by one. Thus, the dimensionality of the space we live in depends on the energy or temperature that we are probing. In particular, we provide a kinematic Brandenberger-Vafa argument for how a discrete {\it causal set}, and eventually a continuum (3+1)-dim spacetime along with Einstein gravity emerge in the Infrared from the worldsheet action. The (3+1)-dim Planck mass and the string scale become directly related, {\it without any} compactification. Amongst other predictions, we argue that LHC might be blind to new physics even if it comes at the TeV scale. In contrast, cosmic ray experiments, especially those that can register the very beginning of the shower, and collisions with high multiplicity and density of particles, might be sensitive to the dimensional cross-over.},

In these examples, the Liouville wall accelerates and can become spacelike in the past and/or future. When that happens, the corresponding null infinity, at which the standard scattering states are defined, is shielded by the Liouville wall. We compute scattering and particle production amplitudes in these backgrounds in the region in parameter space where the wall remains timelike, and discuss the continuation of this picture to the spacelike regime. We also discuss the physics from the point of view of the dynamics of free fermions in backgrounds with a time-dependent Fermi surface.},

  abstract = {(2+1)-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant is a topological theory with no local degrees of freedom. When confined to compact universes which are topologically genus g Riemann surfaces times time, its classical phase space is the cotangent bundle of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. We consider the quantization of moduli space itself, emerging as the zero-momentum slice of this phase space. When a parity-violating ChernSimons term is added to the gravitational action, a nontrivial symplectic form is induced on this slice which is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson K¨ahler form. By demanding that this symplectic form integrate to 2π~ times an integer on every nontrivial two-cycle in moduli space—which is a necessary condition for the system to be quantizable—we find a new quantization condition on the Chern-Simons coupling k 0 . Our result strongly suggests that k 0 must be an integer multiple of 24 in order to define a self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.},

It emphasises the 'quantum cosmology' of closed universes and the quantum mechanics of the (2+1)-dimensional black hole. It compares and contrasts a variety of approaches, and examines what they imply for a realistic theory of quantum gravity. General relativity in three spacetime dimensions has become a popular arena in which to explore the ramifications of quantum gravity. As a diffeomorphism-invariant theory of spacetime structure, this model shares many of the conceptual problems of realistic quantum gravity. But it is also simple enough that many programs of quantization can be carried out explicitly. After analysing the space of classical solutions, this book introduces some fifteen approaches to quantum gravity - from canonical quantization in York's 'extrinsic time' to Chern-Simons quantization, from the loop representation to covariant path integration to lattice methods. Relationships among quantizations are explored, as well as implications for such issues as topology change and the 'problem of time'.
