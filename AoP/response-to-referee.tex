\section{Reviewer \#1}

\subsection{Introduction}

\RC The introduction contrasts string theory and LQG, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. The discussion of background independence in string theory could benefit from references to more recent critiques or developments such as recent advances in non-perturbative string theory.

\AR We have added the following two footnotes with references to recent critiques of string theory's background independence \citep{Hohm2017Background,Hohm2018Background} and recent advances in non-perturbative string theory \citep{Maccaferri2024String,Sen1994Quantum}:

\emph{Recent work has highlighted fundamental challenges to achieving manifest background independence in string theory. Hohm has shown that there exists a fundamental conflict between manifest background independence and duality invariance when higher-derivative corrections are included \citep{Hohm2017Background,Hohm2018Background}.}

\emph{Developments in string field theory continue to address these foundational issues \citep{Maccaferri2024String,Sen1994Quantum} primarily in the framework of string field theory. For an overview of the general concept of background independence in quantum gravity see \citep{Read2023Background}.}

\RC The "central dogma" (minimal area $\Delta$) is well-motivated from LQG but could be better contextualized within existing string theory literature, where minimal length scales are discussed. The paper's goals are clearly stated, but the transition to the modified Nambu-Goto action feels abrupt, a smoother connection between LQG's area quantization and the string action would improve this.

\AR We have added the following paragraphs, including the new references \citep{Amati1989Canb,Chang2011Minimal,Gross1987Highenergy,Gross1988String,Yoneya1989Interpretation,Yoneya2000String}, after the central dogma statement, in order to make the transition between LQG's area quantization and the modified Nambu-Goto action smoother and to include a comparison with previous minimal length proposals in string theory:

\emph{The key insight is to translate this fundamental discreteness of area from spacetime geometry to the worldsheet of the string itself. In LQG, the eigenvalues of the area operator are discrete, meaning physical areas can only take values from a quantized spectrum with minimum eigenvalue $\Delta$. For a string worldsheet, this suggests that the total worldsheet area $\mathcal{A} = \int d^2\sigma \sqrt{-h}$ cannot be arbitrarily small but must satisfy $\mathcal{A} \geq \Delta$.}

\emph{Rather than imposing this constraint externally, we incorporate it directly into the action by modifying the area element itself. The natural way to ensure the worldsheet area respects LQG's minimal area is to replace the standard area element $\sqrt{-h}$ with $\sqrt{-(h+k\Delta)}$ where $k = l_{pl}/l_s$ is the ratio of Planck to string scales. This modification has several appealing features: it reduces to the standard Nambu-Goto action when $k \to 0$, it ensures the worldsheet area can never become arbitrarily small, and it provides a concrete mechanism to incorporate LQG's geometric quantization into string theory.}

\emph{This approach differs from previous minimal length proposals in string theory \citep{Amati1989Canb,Chang2011Minimal,Gross1987Highenergy,Gross1988String,Yoneya1989Interpretation,Yoneya2000String} in that it specifically targets area rather than length, reflecting LQG's emphasis on area as the fundamental geometric observable.}

\subsection{Section 2 - Part (a): Action Justification}

\RC The proposed action $S_{MNG}=-T\int dx^2\sqrt{-(h+k \Delta)}$ needs a clearer justification: the author states in a footnote that $\Delta$ is as a scalar density later identified with the Kalb-Ramond field should be, at least, physically justified because the remaining of this section is based in this argument, otherwise it should be rigorously derived.

\AR We must be honest and state that at present the area modified action is not rigorously derived. We have added a paragraph right after the action area-modified action (eqn 2.2. in the text) to explain this point:

\emph{At present we do not have a rigorous derivation of this expression. It is the simplest possible ansatz one can think of to encode the insight from LQG that at the Planck scale there is a minimum quantum of area. What makes us more confident in this ansatz is that it is consistent with the Kalb-Ramond field identification and the minimal area interpretation of the scalar density $\Delta$. However, this was not known prior to coming up with the ansatz and only discovered after the fact.}

\subsection{Section 2 - Part (b): Expansion Parameter}

\RC The expansion in $k=l_{pl}/l_s$ seems sound, but the assumption $k\ll 1$ (Planck scale much smaller than string scale) should be discussed further—does this hold in all regimes?

\AR We've added the following paragraph right after the expansion parameter $k$ definition to explain our choice of $k \ll 1$:

\emph{If we take $k$ to be an expansion parameter, then it follows that it should also be small. The physical justification for this is the following picture. The microscopic picture of geometry at the Planck scale, which we adopt as the ``correct'' picture, is that given by loop quantum gravity in terms of spin networks and spin foams. The worldsheet picture emerges when one considers a large enough section of the spin network with a sufficiently large number of punctures. In this limit, the spin network can be approximated by a smooth geometry, and the worldsheet picture emerges as a low-energy effective description of the spin network. When $k \sim 1$, the discrete structure of the underlying spin network becomes manifest and the smooth worldsheet approximation is no longer valid, indicating that a full quantum gravitational treatment - i.e. where geometry itself is fully quantum - is required.}

\subsection{Section 2 - Part (c): Duality Interpretation}

\RC The duality between $h_{ab}$ and $h^{ab}$ (Eq. 2.6a-2.6c) is intriguing but lacks a deeper physical interpretation. How does this duality manifest in observable string dynamics?

\AR We have added the following paragraph which hopefully addresses this point:

\emph{This duality is reminiscent of, but also distinct from, the T and S dualities in string theory. In T-duality the behavior of a string compactified on a circle of radius $R$ is related to the behavior of a string compactified on a circle of radius $\alpha'/R$. In S-duality the physics at strong string coupling $g_s \gg 1$ can be mapped to the physics at weak string coupling $g_s \ll 1$. In our case, the duality is between a description of physics at large string tension $T$ and small worldsheet areas $h_{ab}$ and a description of physics at small string tension $T'$ and large worldsheet areas $h'_{ab} = (h_{ab})^{-1}$. This appears to have features of both T-duality and S-duality, in that the area inversion is reminiscent of T-duality and the string tension inversion is reminiscent of S-duality's strong-weak coupling correspondence.}

\subsection{Section 3 - Part (a): Bimetric String and Ghost Avoidance}

\RC The author introduces the connection to bimetric gravity, but the analogy should be strengthened by discussing how the bimetric string avoids issues like the Boulware-Deser ghost.

\AR 

\subsection{Section 3 - Part (b): Kalb-Ramond Field Connection}

\RC The link between $\Delta_{ab}$ and the Kalb-Ramond field $B_{\mu\nu}$ (Sec. 3.2) is a highlight, but the derivation of Eq. (3.21) should be detailed for clarity.

\AR 

\subsection{Section 3 - Part (c): Bimetric Gravity Background}

\RC The section assumes familiarity with bimetric gravity, a brief review of key concepts would aid readers outside this niche.

\AR 

\subsection{Section 4 - Part (a): Physical Meaning of Coupling}

\RC In equations (4.7-4.10) the physical meaning of the coupling between $\phi(x)$, $\Delta$ and $X^\mu$ (akin to a dilaton) needs a more thorough explanation.

\AR 

\subsection{Section 4 - Part (b): Born-Infeld Analogy}

\RC The Born-Infeld analogy (Sec. 4.2) should address why the Kalb-Ramond field must be exact.

\AR 

\subsection{Section 5 - Part (a): Anomaly-Free Claims}

\RC The covariant quantization procedure seems correct, but the absence of anomalies (Sec. 5.12) is a significant claim that deserves more discussion. How does this compare to standard string theory?

\AR 

\subsection{Section 5 - Part (b): Mode Truncation}

\RC The truncation of modes $\alpha_\mu^\nu =0$ for $|n|>d$ due to discreteness needs validation—does this align with other approaches to quantum gravity?

\AR 

\subsection{Section 5 - Part (c): Table 1 Context}

\RC Table 1 (values of $a$ for different $D$ and $\mu$) lacks context. A brief explanation of how these values affect the string spectrum would help.

\AR 

\subsection{Section 6 - Part (a): Afshordi Model Connection}

\RC The link to Afshordi's model is interesting, but the constraints on $m_\mu$ (Eq. 6.3) feel ad hoc, a better and deeper connection to LQG's discreteness would strengthen this section.

\AR 

\subsection{Section 6 - Part (b): Fundamental Spacetime Dimensionality}

\RC The suggestion of (2+1)-dimensional fundamental spacetime (Sec. 6) is speculative and should be better addressed, more evidence or references to support this claim are needed.

\AR 

\subsection{Section 7 - Part (a): Holographic Dimension Interpretation}

\RC The physical interpretation of the emergent holographic dimension $X^r$ as a "scaling dimension" needs clarification.

\AR 

\subsection{Section 7 - Part (b): AdS/CFT Connection}

\RC The connection to AdS/CFT (Sec. 7.2) lacks concrete evidence, how does this classical construction relate to the original Maldacena's duality?

\AR 

\subsection{Discussion - Part (a): Open Questions}

\RC The discussion synthesizes the paper's key results but could better highlight open questions (e.g., experimental signatures, relation to black hole physics), considering the ideas established in the manuscript.

\AR 

\subsection{Discussion - Part (b): Anomaly-Free and Ghost-Free Claims}

\RC The claim that the model is anomaly-free and ghost-free (Sec. 5) should be tempered with caveats (e.g., limitations of the truncation scheme).

\AR 

\subsection{General: Writing and Typos}

\RC A full review should be done to the writing to correct typos.
